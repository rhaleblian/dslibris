<h1><a name="_Toc66932246" id="_Toc66932246">Prologue</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As the captain looked up, the hooded desk
lamp threw his face into ridges of darkness and craggy highlights.
A port stood open to alien summer night.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Well?” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I’ve got it translated, sir,” answered the
sociotechnician. “Had to extrapolate backward from modern
languages, which is what took me so long. In the course of the
work, though, I’ve learned enough so I can talk to these ...
creatures.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Good,” granted the captain. “Now maybe we
can discover what this is all about. Thunder and blowup! I expected
to come across almost anything out here, but this-!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I know how you feel, sir. Even with all the
physical evidence right before my eyes, I found it hard to believe
the original account.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Very well, I’ll read it at once. No rest
for the wicked.” The captain nodded dismissal, and the sociotech
departed the cabin.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For a moment the captain sat motionless,
looking at the document but not really seeing it. The book itself
had been impressively ancient, uncials on vellum between massive
covers. This translation was a prosaic typescript. Yet he was
nearly afraid to turn the pages, afraid of what he might find out.
There had been some stupendous catastrophe, more than a thousand
years ago; its consequences were still echoing. The captain felt
very small and alone. Home was a long ways off.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He began to read.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932247" id="_Toc66932247">Chapter I</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Archbishop William, a most learned and holy
prelate, having commanded me to put into English writing those
great events to which I was a humble witness, I take up my quill in
the name of the Lord and my patron saint: trusting that they will
aid my feeble powers of narrative for the sake of future
generations who may with profit study the account of Sir Roger de
Tourneville’s campaign and learn thereby fervently to reverence the
great God by Whom all things are brought to pass.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I shall write of these happenings exactly as
I remember them, without fear or favor, the more so since most who
were concerned are now dead. I myself was quite insignificant, but
since it is well to make known the chronicler that men may judge
his trustworthiness, let me first say a few words about him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I was born forty years before my story
begins, a younger son of Wat Brown. He was blacksmith in the little
town of Ansby, which lay in northeastern Lincoinshire. The lands
were enfeoffed to the Baron de Tourneville, whose ancient castle
stood on a hill just above the town. There was also a small abbey
of the Franciscan order, which I entered as a boy. Having gained
some skill (my only skill, I fear) in reading and writing, I was
often made instructor in these arts to novices and the children of
lay people. My boyhood nickname I put into Latin and made my
religious one, as a lesson in humility, so I am Brother Parvus. For
I am of low size, and ill-favored, though fortunate to have the
trust of children.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the year of grace 1345, Sir Roger, then
baron, was gathering an army of free companions to join our
puissant King Edward III and his son in the French war. Ansby was
the meeting place. By May Day, the army was all there. It camped on
the common, but turned our quiet town into one huge brawl. Archers,
crossbowmen, pikemen, and cavalry swarmed through the muddy
streets, drinking, gaming, wenching, jesting, and quarreling, to
the peril of their souls and our thatch-roofed cottages. Indeed, we
lost two houses to fire. Yet they brought in unwonted ardor, a
sense of glory, such that the very serfs thought wistfully about
going along, were it but possible. Even I entertained such notions.
For me it might well have come true, for I had been tutoring Sir
Roger’s son and had also brought his accounts in order. The baron
talked of making me his amanuensis; but my abbot was doubtful.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Thus it stood when the Wersgor ship
arrived.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Well I remember the day. I was out on an
errand. The weather had turned sunny after rain, the town street
was ankle-deep in mud. I picked my way through the aimless crowds
of soldiery, nodding to such as I knew. All at once a great cry
arose. I lifted my head like the others.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Lo! It was as a miracle! Down through the
sky, seeming to swell monstrously with the speed of its descent,
came a ship all of metal. So bright was the sunlight off its
polished sides that I could not see its form clearly. A huge
cylinder, I thought, easily two thousand feet long. Save for the
whistle of wind, it moved noiseless.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Someone screamed. A woman knelt in a puddle
and began to rattle off prayers. A man cried that his sins had
found him out, and joined her. Worthy ‘though these actions were, I
realized that in such a mass of people, folk would be trampled to
death if panic smote. That was surely not what God, if He had sent
this visitant, intended.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hardly knowing what I did, I sprang up on a
great iron bombard whose wagon was sunk to the axles in our street.
“Hold fast!” I cried. “Be not afraid! Have faith and hold
fast!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My feeble pipings went unheard. Then Red
John Hameward, the captain of the longbowmen, leaped up beside me.
A merry giant, with hair like spun copper and fierce blue eyes, he
had been my friend since he arrived here.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I know not what yon thing is,” he bellowed.
His voice rolled over the general babble, which died away.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Mayhap some French trick. Or it may be
friendly, which would make our fear look all the sillier. Follow
me, every soldier, to meet it when it lands!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Magic!” cried an old man. “’Tis sorcery,
and we are undone!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Not so,” I told him. “Sorcery cannot harm
good Christians.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But I am a miserable sinner,” he
wailed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“St. George and King Edward!” Red John
sprang off the tube and dashed down the street. I tucked up my robe
and panted after him, trying to remember the formulas of
exorcism.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Looking back over my shoulder, I was
surprised to see most of the company follow us. They had not so
much taken heart from the bowman’s example, as they were afraid to
be left leaderless. But they followed-into their own camp to snatch
weapons, then out onto the common. I saw that cavalrymen had flung
themselves to horse and were thundering downhill from the
castle.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger de Toumeville, unarmored but
wearing sword at hip, led the riders. He shouted and flailed about
with his lance. Between them, he and Red John got the rabble
whipped into some kind of fighting order. They had scarcely
finished when the great ship landed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It sank deep into pasture earth; its weight
was tremendous, and I knew not what had borne it so lightly through
the air. I saw that it was all enclosed, a smooth shell without
poop deck or forecastle. I did not really expect oars, but part of
me wondered (through the hammering of my heart) why there were no
sails. However, I did spy turrets, from which poked muzzles like
those of bombards.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There fell a shuddering silence. Sir Roger
edged his horse up to me where I stood with teeth clapping in my
head. “You’re a learned cleric, Brother Parvus,” he said quietly,
though his nostrils were white and his hair dank with sweat. “What
d’you make of this?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“In truth I know not, sire,” I stammered.
“Ancient stories tell of wizards like Merlin who could fly through
the air.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Could it be ... divine?” He crossed
himself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“’Tis not for me to say.” I looked timidly
skyward. “Yet I see no choir of angels.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A muted clank came from the vessel, drowned
in one groan of fear as a circular door began to open. But all
stood their ground, being Englishmen, if not simply too terrified
to run.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I glimpsed that the door was double, with a
chamber between. A metallic ramp slid forth like a tongue, three
yards downward until it touched the earth. I raised my crucifix
while Ayes pattered from my lips like hail.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One of the crew came forth. Great Cod, how
shall I describe the horror of that first sight? Surely, my mind
shrieked, this was a demon from the lowest pits of hell.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He stood about five feet tall, very broad
and powerful, clad in a tunic of silvery sheen. His skin was
hairless and deep blue. He had a short thick tail. The ears were
long and pointed on either side of his round head; narrow amber
eyes glared from a blunt-snouted face; but his brow was high.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Someone began to scream. Red John brandished
his bow. “Quiet, there!” he roared. “’Steeth, I’ll kill the first
man who moves!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I hardly thought this a time for profanity.
Raising the cross still higher, I forced limp legs to carry me a
few steps forward, while I quavered some chant of exorcism. I was
certain it would do no good; the end of the world was upon us.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Had the demon only remained standing there,
we would soon have broken and bolted. But he raised a tube held in
one hand. From it shot flame, blinding white. I heard it crackle in
the air and saw a man near me smitten.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Fire burst over him. He fell dead, his
breast charred open.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Three other demons emerged.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Soldiers were trained to react when such
things happened, not to think. The bow of Red John sang. The
foremost demon lurched off the ramp with a cloth-yard arrow through
him. I saw him cough blood and die. As if the one shot had touched
off a hundred, the air was suddenly gray with whistling shafts. The
three other demons toppled, so thickly studded with arrows they
might have been popinjays at a contest.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“They can be slain!” bawled Sir Roger.
“Haro! St. George for merry England!” And he spurred his horse
straight up the gangway.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">They say fear breeds unnatural courage. With
one crazed whoop the whole army charged after him. Be it confessed,
I, too, howled and ran into the ship.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Of that combat which ramped and raged
through all the rooms and corridors, I have little memory.
Somewhere, from someone, I got a battle-ax. There is in me a
confused impression of smiting away at vile blue faces which rose
up to snarl at me, of slipping in blood and rising to smite again.
Sir Roger had no way to direct the battle. His men simply ran wild.
Knowing the demons could be killed, their one thought was to kill
and have done.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The crew of the ship numbered about a
hundred, but few carried weapons. We later found all manner of
devices stored in the holds, but the invaders had relied on
creating a panic. Not knowing Englishmen, they had not expected
trouble. The ship s artillery was ready to use, but of no value
once we were inside.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In less than an hour, we had hunted them all
down.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Wading out through the carnage, I wept with
joy to feel the blessed sunlight again. Sir Roger was checking with
his captains to find our losses, which were only fifteen all told.
As I stood there, atremble with exhaustion, Red John Hameward
emerged. He had a demon slung over his shoulder.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He threw the creature at Sir Roger’s feet.
“This one I knocked out with my fist, sire,” he panted. “I thought
might be you’d want one kept alive awhile, to put him to the
question. Or should I not take chances, and slice off his ugly head
now?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger considered. Calm had descended
upon him; none of us had yet grasped the enormity of this event. A
grim smile crossed his lips. He replied in English as fluent as the
nobleman’s French he more commonly used.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“if these be demons,” he said, “they’re a
poor breed, for they were slain as easily as men. Easier, in sooth.
They didn’t know more about infighting than my little daughter.
Less, for she’s given my nose many hefty tweaks. I think chains
will hold this fellow safe, eh, Brother Parvus?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yes, my lord,” I opined, “though it were
best to put some saints’ relics and the Host near by.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, then, take him to the abbey and see
what you can get out of him. I’ll send a guard along. Come up to
dinner this evening.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Sire,” I reproved, “we should hold a great
Mass of thanksgiving ere we do anything else.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yes, yes,” he said impatiently. “Talk to
your abbot about it. Do what seems best. But come to dinner and
tell me what you’ve learned.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His eyes grew thoughtful as he stared at the
ship.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932248" id="_Toc66932248">Chapter II</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I came as ordered, with the approval of my
abbot, who saw that here the ghostly and secular arms must be one.
The town was strangely quiet as I picked my way through sunset
streets. Folk were in church or huddled within doors. From the
soldiers’ camp I could hear yet another Mass, The ship brooded
mountainous over all our tiny works.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But we felt heartened, I believe, a little
drunk with our success over powers not of this earth, The smug
conclusion seemed inescapable, that Cod approved of us.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I passed the bailey through a trebled watch
and went directly to the great hail. Ansby Castle was old Norman
work, gaunt to look on, cold to inhabit. The hail was already dark,
lit by candles and a great leaping fire which picked weapons and
tapestries out of unrestful shadow. Gentlefolk and the more
important commoners of town and army were at table, a buzz of talk,
servants scurrying about, dogs lolling on the rushes. It was a
comfortingly familiar scene, however much tension underlay it. Sir
Roger beckoned me to come sit with him and his lady, a signal
honor.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Let me here describe Roger de Toumeville,
knight and baron. He was a big, strongly thewed man of thirty
years, with gray eyes and bony curve-nosed features. He wore his
yellow hair in the usual style of a warrior peer, thick on the
crown and shaven below- which somewhat marred an otherwise not
unhandsome appearance, for he had ears like jug handles. This, his
home district, was poor and backward, and most of his time
elsewhere had been spent in war. So he lacked courtly graces,
though shrewd and kindly in his fashion. His wife, Lady Catherine,
was a daughter of the Viscount de Mornay; most people felt she had
married beneath her style of living as well as her station, for she
had been brought up at Winchester amidst every elegance and modern
refinement. She was very beautiful, with great blue eyes and auburn
hair, but somewhat of a virago. They had only two children: Robert,
a fine boy of six, who was my pupil, and a three-year-old girl
named Matilda.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, Brother Parvus,” boomed my lord. “Sit
down. Have a stoup of winesblood, this occasion calls for more than
ale!” Lady Catherine’s delicate nose wrinkled a bit; in her old
home, ale was only for commoners. When I was seated, Sir Roger
leaned forward and said intently, “What have you found out? Is it a
demon we’ve captured?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A hush fell over the table. Even the dogs
were quiet. I could hear the hearth fire crackle and ancient
banners stir dustily where they hung from the beams overhead. “I
think so, my lord,” I answered with care, “for he grew very angry
when we sprinkled holy water on him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yet he did not vanish in a puff of smoke?
Hah! If demons, these are not kin to any I ever heard of. They’re
mortal as men.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“More so, sire,” declared one of his
captains, “for they cannot have souls.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘I’m not interested in their blithering
souls,” snorted Sir Roger. “I want to know about their ship. I’ve
walked through it since the fight. What a by-our-lady whale of a
ship! We could put all Ansby aboard, with room to spare. Did you
ask the demon why a mere hundred of ‘em needed that much
space?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“He does not speak any known language, my
lord,” I said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nonsense! All demons know Latin, at least.
He’s just being stubborn.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Mayhap a little session with your
executioner?” asked the knight Sir Owain Montbelle slyly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No,” I said. “If it please you, best not.
He seems very quick at learning. Already he repeats many words
after me, so I do not believe he is merely pretending ignorance.
Give me a few days and I may be able to talk with him.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“A few days may be too much,” grumbled Sir
Roger. He threw the beef bone he had been gnawing to the dogs and
licked his fingers noisily. Lady Catherine frowned and pointed to
the water bowl and napkin before him. “I’m sorry, my sweet,” he
muttered. “I never can remember about these newfangled things.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain delivered him from his
embarrassment by inquiring: “Why say you a few days may be too
long? Surely you are not expecting another ship?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘No. But the men will be more restless than
ever. We were almost ready to depart, and now this happens!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘So? Can we not leave anyhow on the date
planned?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No, you blockhead!” Sir Roger’s fist landed
on the table. A goblet jumped. “Cannot you see what a chance this
is? It must have been given us by the saints themselves!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As we sat awestruck, he went on rapidly: “We
can take the whole company aboard that thing. Horses, cows, pigs,
fowls-we’ll not be deviled by supply problems. Women, too, all the
comforts of home! Aye, why not even the children? Never mind the
crews hereabouts, they can stand neglect for a while and tis safer
to keep everyone together lest there should be another
visitation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I know not what powers the ship owns
besides flying, but her very appearance will strike such terror
we’ll scarce need to fight. So we’ll take her across the Channel
and end the French war inside a month, d’ you see? Then we go on
and liberate the Holy Land, and get back here in time for hay
harvest!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A long silence ended abruptly in such a
storm of cheers that my own weak protests were drowned out. I
thought the scheme altogether mad. So, I could see, did Lady
Catherine and a few others. But the rest were laughing and shouting
till the hail roared.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger turned a flushed face to me. “It
depends on you, Brother Parvus,” he said. “You’re the best of us
all in matters of language. You must make the demon talk, or teach
him how, whichever it is. He’s got to show us how to sail that
ship!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“My noble lord-“ I quavered.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Good!” Sir Roger slapped my back so I
choked and nearly fell off my seat. “I knew you could do it. Your
reward will be the privilege of coming with us!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Indeed, it was as if the town and the army
were alike possessed. Surely the one wise course was to send
messages posthaste to the bishop, perhaps to Rome itself, begging
counsel, But no, they must all go, at once. Wives would not leave
their husbands, or parents their children, or girls their lovers.
The lowliest serf looked up from his acre and dreamed of freeing
the Holy Land and picking up a coffer of gold on the way.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">What else can be expected of a folk bred
from Saxon, Dane, and Norman?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I returned to the abbey and spent the night
on my knees, praying for a sign. But the saints remained
noncommittal. After matins I went with a heavy heart to my abbot
and told him what the baron had commanded. He was wroth at not
being allowed immediate communication with the Church authorities
but decided it was best we obey for the nonce. I was released from
other duties that I might study how to converse with the demon.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I girded myself and went down to the cell
where he was confined. It was a narrow room, half underground, used
for penances. Brother Thomas, our smith, had stapled fetters to the
wails and chained the creature up. He lay on a straw pallet, a
frightful sight in the gloom. His links clashed as he rose at my
entry. Our relics in their chests were placed near by, just out of
his impious reach, so that the thighbone of St. Osbert and the
sixth-year molar of St. Willibald might keep him from bursting his
bonds and escaping back to hell.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Though I would not have been at all sorry
had he done so.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I crossed myself and squatted down. His
yellow eyes glared at me. I had brought paper, ink, and quills, to
exercise what small talent I have for drawing. I sketched a man and
said, “Homo,” for it seemed wiser to teach him Latin than any
language confined to a single nation. Then I drew another man and
showed him that the two were called homines. Thus it went, and he
was quick to learn.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Presently he signaled for the paper, and I
gave it to him. He himself drew skillfully. He told me that his
name was Branithar and that his race was called Wersgorix. I was
unable to find these terms in any demonology. But thereafter I let
him guide our studies, for his race had made the learning of new
languages into a science, and our task went apace.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I worked long hours with him and saw little
of the outside world in the next few days. Sir Roger kept his
domain incommunicado. I think his greatest fear was that some earl
or duke might seize the ship for himself. With his bolder men, the
baron spent much time aboard it, trying to fathom all the wonders
he encountered.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Erelong Branithar was able to complain about
the bread-and-water diet and threaten revenge. I was still afraid
of him but kept up a bold front. Of course, our conversation was
much slower than I here render it, with many pauses while we
searched for words.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You brought this on yourself,” I told him.
“You should have known better than to make an unprovoked attack on
Christians.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What are Christians?” he asked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Dumfounded, I thought he must be feigning
ignorance. As a test, I led him through the Paternoster. He did not
go up in smoke, which puzzled me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I think I understand,” he said. “You refer
to some primitive tribal pantheon.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It is no such heathen thing!” I said
indignantly. I started to explain the Trinity to him, but had
scarcely gotten to transubstantiation when he waved an impatient
blue hand. It was much like a human hand otherwise, save for the
thick, sharp nails.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No matter,” he said. “Are all Christians as
ferocious as your people?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You would have had better luck with the
French,” I admitted. “Your misfortune was landing among
Englishmen.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘A stubborn breed,” he nodded. “It will cost
you dearly. But if you release me at once, I will try to mitigate
the vengeance which is going to fall on you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, but
I unstuck it and asked him coolly enough to elucidate. Whence came
he, and what were his intentions?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">That took a long time for him to make clear,
because the very concepts were strange. I thought surely he was
lying, but at least he acquired more Latin in the process.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It was about two weeks after the landing
when Sir Owain Montbelle appeared at the abbey and demanded
audience with me. I met him in the cloister garden; we found a
bench and sat down.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This Owain was the younger son, by a second
marriage with a Welsh woman, of a petty baron on the Marches. I
daresay the ancient conflict of two nations smoldered strangely in
his breast; but the Cymric charm was also there. Made page and
later esquire to a great knight in the royal court, young Owain had
captured his master’s heart and been brought up with all the
privilege of far higher ranks. He had traveled widely abroad,
become a troubadour of some note, received the accolade-and then
suddenly, there he was, penniless. In hopes of winning his fortune,
he had wandered to Ansby to join the free companions. Though
valiant enough, he was too darkly handsome for most men’s taste,
and they said no husband felt safe when he was about. This was not
quite true, for Sir Roger had taken a fancy to the youth, admired
his judgment as well as his education, and was happy that at last
Lady Catherine had someone to talk to about the things that most
interested her.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I come from my lord, Brother Parvus,” Sir
Owain began. “He wishes to know how much longer you will need to
tame this beast of ours,”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh ... he speaks glibly enough now,” I
answered. “But he holds so firmly to out-and-out falsehoods that I
have not yet thought it worth while to report.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Sir Roger grows most impatient, and the men
can scarcely be held any longer. They devour his substance, and not
a night passes without a brawl or a murder. We must start soon or
not at all.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Then I beg thou not to go,” I said. “Not in
yon ship out of hell.’ I could see that dizzyingly tail spire, its
nose wreathed with low clouds, rearing beyond the abbey walls. It
terrified me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well,” snapped Sir Owain, “what has the
monster told you?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“He has the impudence to claim he comes not
from below, but from above. From heaven itself!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“He ... an angel?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No. He says he is neither angel nor demon,
but a member of another mortal race than mankind.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain caressed his smooth-shaven chin
with one hand. “It could be,” he mused. “After all, if Unipeds and
Centaurs and other monstrous beings exist, why not those squatty
blueskins?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I know. Twould be reasonable enough, save
that he claims to live in the sky.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Tell me just what he did say.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“As you will, Sir Owain, but remember that
these impieties are not mine. This Branithar insists that the earth
is not flat but is a sphere hanging in space. Nay, he goes further
and says the earth moves about the sun! Some of the learned
ancients held similar notions, but I cannot understand what would
keep the oceans from pouring off into space or-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Pray continue the story, Brother
Parvus.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, Branithar says that the stars are
other suns than ours, only very far off, and have worlds going
about them even as our own does. Not even the Greeks could have
swallowed such an absurdity. What kind of ignorant yokels does the
creature take us for? But be this as it may, Branithar says that
his people, the Wersgorix, come from one of these other worlds, one
which is much like our earth. He boasts of their powers of
sorcery-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“That much is no lie,” said Sir Owain.
“We’ve been trying out some of those hand weapons. We burned down
three houses, a pig, and a serf ere we learned how to control
them.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I gulped, but went On: “These Wersgorix have
ships which can fly between the stars. They have conquered many
worlds. Their method is to subdue or wipe out any backward natives
there may be. Then they settle the entire world, each Wersgor
taking hundreds of thousands of acres. Their numbers are growing so
fast, and they so dislike being crowded, that they must ever be
seeking new worlds.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“This ship we captured was a scout,
exploring in search of another place to conquer. Having observed
our earth from above, they decided it was suitable for their use
and descended. Their plan was the usual one, which had never failed
them hitherto. They would terrorize us, use our home as a base, and
range about gathering specimens of plants, animals, and minerals.
That is the reason their ship is so big, with so much empty space.
‘Twas to be a veritable Noah’s ark. When they returned home and
reported their findings, a fleet would come to attack all
mankind.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Hmmm,” said Sir Owain. “We stopped that
much, at least.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We were both cushioned against the frightful
vision of ourpoor folk being harried by unhumans, destroyed or
enslaved, because neither of us really believed it. I had decided
that Branithar came from a distant part of the world, perhaps
beyond Cathay, and only told these lies in the hope of frightening
us into letting him go. Sir Owain agreed with my theory.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nonetheless,” added the knight, “we must
certainly learn to use the ship, lest more of them arrive. And what
better way to learn, than by taking it to France and Jerusalem? As
my lord said, ‘twould in that case be prudent as well as
comfortable to have women, children, yeomen, and townsfolk along.
Have you asked the beast how to cast the spells for working the
ship?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yes,” I answered reluctantly. “He says the
rudder is very simple.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And have you told him what will happen to
him if he does not pilot us faithfully?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I have intimated. He says he will
obey.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Good! Then we can start in another day or
two!” Sir Owain leaned back, eyes dreamily half closed. “We must
eventually see about getting word back to his own people. One could
buy much wine and amuse many fair women with his ransom.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932249" id="_Toc66932249">Chapter III</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And so we departed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Stranger even than the ship and its advent
was that embarkation. There the thing towered, like a steel cliff
forged by a wizard for a hideous use. On the other side of the
common huddled little Ansby, thatched cots and rutted streets,
fields green beneath our wan English sky. The very castle, once so
dominant in the scene, looked shrunken and gray.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But up the ramps we had let down from many
levels, into the gleaming pillar, thronged our homely, red-faced,
sweating, laughing people. Here John Hamewaid roared along with his
bow across one shoulder and a tavern wench giggling on the other.
There a yeoman armed with a rusty ax that might have been swung at
Hastings, clad in patched wadmal, preceded a scolding wife burdened
with their bedding and cooking pot, and half a dozen children
clinging to her skirts. Here a crossbowman tried to make a stubborn
mule climb the gangway, his oaths laying many years in Purgatory to
his account. There a lad chased a pig which had gotten loose. Here
a richly clad knight jested with a fine lady who bore a hooded
falcon on her wrist. There a priest told his beads as he went
doubtfully into the iron maw. Here a cow lowed, there a sheep
bleated, here a goat shook its horns, there a hen cackled. All
told, some two thousand souls went aboard.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The ship held them easily. Each important
man could have a cabin for himself and his lady-for several had
brought wives, lemans, or both as far as Ansby Castle, to make a
more social occasion of the departure for France. The commoners
spread pallets in empty holds. Poor Ansby was left almost deserted,
and I often wonder if it still exists.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger had made Branithar operate the
ship on some trial flights. It had risen smoothly and silently as
he worked the wheels and levers and knobs in the control turret.
Steering was childishly simple, though we could make neither head
nor tail of certain discs with heathenish inscriptions, across
which quivered needles. Through me, Branithar told Sir Roger that
the ship derived its motive power from the destruction of matter, a
horrid idea indeed, and that its engines raised and propelled it by
nullifying the pull of the earth along chosen directions. This was
senseless- Aristotle has explained very clearly how things fall to
the ground because it is their nature to fall, and I have no truck
with illogical ideas to which flighty heads so easily succumb.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Despite his own reservations, the abbot
joined Father Simon in blessing the ship. We named her Crusader.
Though we only had two chaplains along, we had also borrowed a lock
of St. Benedict’s hair, and all who embarked had confessed and
received absolution. So it was thought we were safe enough from
ghostly peril, though I had my doubts.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I was given a small cabin adjoining the
suite in which Sir Roger lived with his lady and their children.
Branithar was kept under guard in a near-by room. My duty was to
interpret, to continue the prisoner’s instruction in Latin and the
education of young Robert, and to act as my lord’s amanuensis.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At departure, however, the control turret
was occupied by Sir Roger, Sir Owain, Branithar, and myself. It was
windowless, like the entire ship, but held glassy screens in which
appeared images of the earth below and all the sky around. I
shivered and told my beads, for it is not lawful for Christian men
to gaze into the crystal globes of Indic sorcerers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Now, then,” said Sir Roger, and his hooked
face laughed at me, “let’s away! We’ll be in France within the
hour!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He sat down before the panel of levers and
wheels. Branithar said quickly to me: “The trial flights were only
a few miles. Tell your master that for a trip of this length
certain special preparations must be made.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger nodded when I had passed this on.
“Very well, let him do so.” His sword slithered from the sheath.
“But I’ll be watching our course in the screens. At the first sign
of treachery-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain scowled. “Is this wise, my lord?”
he asked. “The beast-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Is our prisoner. You’re too full of Celtic
superstitions, Owain. Let him begin.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar seated himself. The furnishings of
the ship, chairs and tables and beds and cabinets, were somewhat
small for us humans-and badly designed, without so much as a carven
dragon for ornament. But we could make do with them. I watched the
captive intently as his blue hands moved over the panel.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A deep humming trembled in the ship. I felt
nothing, but the ground in the lower screens suddenly dwindled.
That was sorcerous; I would much rather the usual backward thrust
of a vehicle when it starts were not annulled. Fighting down my
stomach, I stared into the screen-reflected vault of heaven. Ere
long we were among the clouds, which proved to be high floating
mists. Clearly this shows the wondrous power of God, for it is
known that the angels often sit about on the clouds, and do not get
wet.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Now, southward,” ordered Sir Roger.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar grunted, set a dial, and snapped
down a bar. I heard a clicking as of a lock. The bar stayed
down.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hellish triumph flared in the yellow eyes.
Branithar sprang from his seat and snarled at me; “Consummati
estis!’ His Latin was very bad. “You are finished! I have just sent
you to death!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What?” I cried.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger cursed, half understanding, and
lunged at the Wersgor. But the sight of what was in the screens
checked him. The sword clattered from his hand, and sweat leaped
out on his face.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Truly it was terrible. The earth dwindled
beneath us as if it were falling down a great well. About us, the
blue sky darkened, and stars glittered forth. Yet it was not
nightfall, for the sun still shone in one screen, more brightly
than ever!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain screamed something in Welsh. I
fell to my knees.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar darted for the door. Sir Roger
whirled and grasped him by his robe. They went over in a raging
tangle.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain was paralyzed by terror, and I
could not pull my eyes from the horrible beauty of the spectacle
about us. Earth shrank so small that it only filled one screen. It
was blue, banded, with dark splotches, and round. Round!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A new and deeper note entered the low drone
in the air. New needles on the control panel quivered to life.
Suddenly we were moving, gaining speed, with impossible swiftness.
An altogether different set of engines, acting on a wholly unknown
principle, had unwound their ropes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I saw the moon swell before us. Even as I
stared, we passed so near that I could see mountains and pockmarks
upon it, edged with their o*n shadows. But this was inconceivable!
All knew the moon to be a perfect circle. Sobbing, I tried to break
that liar of a vision screen, but could not.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger overcame Branithar and stretched
him half-conscious on the deck. The knight got up, breathing
heavily. “Where are we?” he gasped. “What’s happened?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘We’re going up,” I groaned. “Up and out.” I
put my fingers in my ears so as not to be deafened when we crashed
into the first of the crystal spheres.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">After a while, when nothing had occurred, I
opened my eyes and looked again. Earth and moon were both receding,
little more than a doubled star of blue and gold. The real stars
flamed hard, unwinking, against an infinite blackness. It seemed to
me that we were still picking up speed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger cut off my prayers with an oath.
“We’ve this traitor to handle first!” He kicked Branithar in the
ribs. The Wersgor sat up and glared defiance.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I collected my wits and said to him in
Latin, “What have you done? You will die by torture unless you take
us back at once.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He rose, folded his arms, and regarded us
with bitter pride. “Did you think that you barbarians were any
match for a civilized mind?” he answered. “Do what you will with
me. There will be revenge enough when you come to this journey’s
end.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But what have you done?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His bruised mouth grinned. “I set the ship
under control of its automaton-pilot. It is now steering itself.
Everything is automatic-the departure from atmosphere, the
switch-over into translight quasi-velocity, the compensation for
optical effects, the preservation of artificial gravity and other
environmental factors.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, turn off the engines!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No one can. I could not do so myself, now
that the lock-bar is down. It will remain down until we get to
Tharixan. And that is the nearest world settled by my people!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I tried the controls, gingerly. They could
not be moved. When I told the knights, Sir Owain moaned aloud.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But Sir Roger said grimly: “We’ll find
whether that is the truth or not. The questioning will at least
punish his betrayal!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Through me, Branithar replied with scorn:
“Vent your spite if you must. I am not afraid of you. But I say
that even if you broke my will, it would be useless. The rudder
settings cannot be changed now, nor the ship halted. The lock-bar
is meant for situations when a vessel must be sent somewhere with
no one aboard.” After a moment he added earnestly: “You must
understand, though, I bear you no malice. You are foolhardy, but I
could almost regret the fact that we need your world for ourselves.
If you will spare me, I shall intercede for you when we get to
Tharixan. Your own lives may be given you, at least.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger rubbed his chin thoughtfully. I
heard the bristles scratch under his palm, though he had shaved
only last Thursday. “I gather the ship will become manageable again
when we reach this destination,” he said. I was amazed how coolly
he took it after the first shock. “Could we not turn about then and
go home?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I will never guide you!” said Branithar to
that. “And alone, unable to read our navigational books, you would
never find the way. We will be farther from your world than light
can travel in a thousand of your years.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You might have the courtesy not to insult
our intelligence,” I huffed. “I know as well as you do that light
has an infinite velocity.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He shrugged.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A gleam lit Sir Roger’s eye. “When will we
arrive?” he asked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“In ten days,” Branithar informed us. It is
not the distances between stars, great though they are, that has
made us so slow to reach your world. We have been expanding for
three centuries. It is the sheer number of suns.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Hmm. When we arrive, we have this fine ship
to use, with its bombards and the hand weapons. The Wersgorix may
regret our visit!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I translated for Branithar, who answered, “I
sincerely advise you to surrender at once. True, these fire-beams
of ours can slay a man, or reduce a city to slag. But you will find
them useless, because we have screens of pure force which will stop
any such beam. The ship is not so protected, since the generators
of a force shield are too bulky for it. Thus the guns of the
fortress can shoot upward and destroy you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When Sir Roger heard this, he said only:
“Well, we’ve ten days to think it over. Let this remain a secret.
No one can see out of the ship, save from this place. I’ll think of
some tale that won’t alarm the folk too much.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He went out, his cloak swirling behind him
like great wings.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc66932250" id="_Toc66932250">Chapter IV</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I was the least of our troop, and much
happened in which I had no part. Yet I shall set it down as fully
as may be, using conjecture to fill in the gaps of knowledge. The
chaplains heard much in confession, and without violating
confidence they were ever quick to correct false impressions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I believe, therefore, that Sir Roger took
Catherine his lady aside and told her how matters stood. He had
hoped for calm and courage from her, but she flew into the
bitterest of rages.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ill was the day I wed you!” she cried. Her
lovely face turned red and then white, and she stamped a small foot
on the steel deck. “Bad enough that your oafishness should disgrace
me before king and court, and doom me to yawn my life away in that
bear’s den you call a castle. Now you set the lives and the very
souls of my children at hazard!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But, dearest,” he stammered. “I could not
know-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No, you were too stupid! ‘Twas not enough
to go robbing and whoring off into France, you must needs do it in
this aerial coffin. Your arrogance told you the demon was so afraid
of you he would be your obedient slave. Mary, pity women!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She whirled, sobbing, and hurried from
him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger stared after her till she had
vanished down the long corridor. Then, heavyhearted, he betook
himself to see his troopers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He found them in the afterhold, cooking
their supper. The air remained sweet in spite of all the fires we
lit; Branithar told me the ship embodied a system for renewing the
vital spirits of the atmosphere. I found it somewhat unnerving
always to have the walls luminous and not know day from night. But
the common soldiers sat around, hoisting ale crocks, bragging,
dicing, cracking fleas, a wild, godless crew who nonetheless
cheered their lord with real affection.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger signaled to Red John Hameward,
whose huge form lumbered to join him in a small side chamber.
“Well, sire,” he remarked, “it seems a longish ways to France after
all.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Plans have been, urn, changed,” Sir Roger
told him carefully. “It seems there may be a rare booty in the
homeland of this ship. With that, we could equip an army large
enough not only to take, but to hold and settle all our
conquests.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Red John belched and scratched under his
doublet. “If we don’t run into more nor we can handle, sire.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I think not. But you must prepare your men
for this change of plan and soothe whatever fears they have.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“That’lI not be easy, sire.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Why not? I told you the plunder would be
good.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, my lord, if you want the honest
truth, ‘tis in this wise. You see, though we’ve most of the Anshy
women along, and many of ‘em are unwed and, urn, friendly disposed
... even so, my lord, the fact remains, d’ you see, we’ve twice as
many men as women. Now the French girls are fair, and belike the
Saracen wenches would do in a pinch-indeed, they’re said to be very
pinchable-but, judging from those blueskins we overmastered, well,
their females aren’t so handsome.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“How do you know they don’t hold beautiful
princesses in captivity that yearn for an honest English face?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“That’s so, my lord. It could well be.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Then see you have the bowmen ready to fight
when we arrive.” Sir Roger clapped the giant on the shoulder and
went out to speak similarly with his other captains.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He mentioned this question of women to me
somewhat later, and I was horrified. “God be praised, that He made
the Wersgorix so unattractive, if they are of another species!” I
exclaimed. “Great is His forethought!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ill-favored though they be,” asked the
baron, “are you sure they’re not human?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Would God I knew, sire,” I answered after
thinking about it. “They look like naught on earth. Yet they do go
on two legs, have hands, speech, the power of reason.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It matters little,” he decided.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh, but it matters greatly, sire!” I told
him. “For see you, if they have souls, then it is our plain duty to
win them to the Faith. But if they have not, it were blasphemous to
give them the sacraments.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I 11 let you find out which,” he said
indifferently.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I hurried forthwith to Branithar’s cabin,
which was guarded by a couple of spearmen. “What would you?” he
asked when I sat down.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Have you a soul?” I inquired.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“A what?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I explained what spiritus meant. He was
still puzzled. “Do you really think a miniature of yourself lives
in your head?” he asked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh, no. The soul is not material. It is
what gives life-well, not exactly that, since animals are alive-
will, the self-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I see. The brain.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No, no, no! The soul is, well, that which
lives on after the body is dead, and faces judgment for its actions
during life.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ah. You believe, then, that the personality
survives after death. An interesting problem. If personality is a
pattern rather than a material object, as seems reasonable, then it
is theoretically possible that this pattern may be transferred to
something else, the same system of relationships but in another
physical matrix.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Stop maundering!” I snapped impatiently.
“You are worse than an Albigensian. Tell me in plain words, do you
or do you not have a soul?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Our scientists have investigated the
problems involved in a pattern concept of personality, but, so far
as I know, data are still lacking on which to base a
conclusion.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“There you go again.” I sighed. “Can you not
give me a simple answer? Just tell me whether or not you have a
soul.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You’re no help at all,” I scolded him, and
left.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My colleagues and I debated the problem at
length, but except for the obvious fact that provisional baptism
could be given any nonhumans willing to receive it, no solution was
reached. It was a matter for Rome, perhaps for an ecumenical
council.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While all this went on, Lady Catherine had
mastered her tears and swept haughtily on down a passageway,
seeking to ease her inner turmoil by motion. In the long room where
the captains dined, she found Sir Owain tuning his harp. He leaped
to his feet and bowed. “My lady! This is a pleasant ... I might say
dazzling.., surprise.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She sat down on a bench. “Where are we now?”
she asked in sudden surrender to her weariness.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Perceiving that she knew the truth, he
replied, “I don’t know. Already the sun itself has shrunk till we
have lost view of it among the stars.” A slow smile kindled in his
dark face. “Yet there is sun enough in this chamber.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine felt a blush go up her cheeks. She
looked down at her shoes. Her own lips stirred upward, unwilled by
herself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We are on the loneliest voyage men ever
undertook,” said Sir Owain. “If my lady will permit, I’ll seek to
while away an hour of it with a song cycle dedicated to her
charms.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She did not refuse more than once. His voice
rose until it filled the room.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc66932251" id="_Toc66932251">Chapter V</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There is a little to tell of the outward
journey. The tedium of it soon bulked larger than the perils.
Knights exchanged harsh words, and John Hameward had to crack more
than one pair of heads together to keep order among his bowmen. The
serfs took it best; when not caring for livestock, or eating, they
merely slept.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I noticed that Lady Catherine was often at
converse with Sir Owain, and that her husband was no longer
overjoyed about it. However, he was always caught up in some plan
or preparation, and the younger knight did give her hours of
distraction, even of merriment.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger and I spent much time with
Branithar, who was willing enough to tell us about his race and its
empire. I was reluctantly coming to believe his claims. Strange
that so ugly a breed should dwell in what I judged to be the Third
Heaven, but the fact could not be denied. Belike, I thought, when
Scripture mentioned the four corners of the world, it did not mean
our planet Terra at all, but referred to a cubical universe. Beyond
this must lie the abode of the blessed; while Branithar’s remark
about the molten interior of the earth was certainly consonant with
prophetic visions of hell.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar told us that there were about a
hundred worlds like our own in the Wersgor empire. They circled as
many separate stars, for no sun was likely to have more than one
habitable planet. Each of these worlds was the dwelling place of a
few million Wersgorix, who liked plenty of room. Except for the
capital planet, Wersgorixan, they bore no cities. But those on the
frontiers of the empire, like Tharixan whither we were bound, had
fortresses which were also space navy bases. Branithar stressed the
firepower and impregnability of these castles.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If a usable planet had intelligent natives,
these were either exterminated or enslaved. The Wersgorix did no
menial work, leaving this to such helots, or to automata.
Themselves they were soldiers, managers of their vast estates,
traders, owners of manufactories, politicians, and courtiers. Being
unarmed, the enslaved natives had no hope of revolting against the
relatively small number of alien masters. Sir Roger muttered
something about distributing weapons to these oppressed beings when
we arrived and telling them about the Jacquerie. But Branithar
guessed his intent, laughed, and said Tharixan had never been
inhabited, so there were only a few hundred slaves on the entire
planet.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This empire filled a rough sphere in space,
about two thousand light-years across. (A light-year being the
incredible distance that light covers in one standard Wersgor year,
which Branithar said was about 10 percent longer than the
Terrestrial period.) It included millions of suns with their
worlds. But most of these, because of poisonous air or poisonous
life forms or other things, were useless to the Wersgorix and
ignored.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger asked if they were the only~
nation which had learned to fly between the stars. Branithar
shrugged contemptuously. “We have encountered three others, who
developed the art independently,” he said. “They live within the
sphere of our empire, but so far we have not subdued them. It was
not worth while, when primitive planets are such easier game. We
allow these three races to traffic, and to keep the small number of
colonies they had already established in other planetary systems.
But we have not allowed them to continue expanding. A couple of
minor wars settled that. They have no love for us: they know we
will destroy them someday when it is convenient for us to do so,
but they are helpless in the face of overwhelming power.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I see,” nodded the baron.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He instructed me to start learning the
Wersgor language. Branithar found it amusing to teach me, and I
could smother my own fears by hard work, so it went quite fast.
Their tongue was barbarous, lacking the noble inflections of Latin,
but on that account not hard to master.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the control turret I found drawers full
of charts and numerical tables. All the writing was beautifully
exact; I thought they must have such scribes it was a pity they had
not gone on to illuminate the pages. Puzzling over these, and using
what I had learned of the Wersgor speech and alphabet, I decided
this was a set of navigational directions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A regular map of the planet Tharixan was
included, since this had been the home base of the expedition. I
translated the symbols for land, sea, river, fortress, and so on.
Sir Roger pored long hours over it. Even the Saracen chart his
grandfather had brought back from the Holy Land was crude compared
to this; though on the other hand the Wersgorix showed lack of
culture by omitting pictures of mermaids, the four winds,
hippogriffs, and similar ornamentation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I also deciphered the legends on some of the
control panel instruments. Such dials as those for altitude and
speed could readily be mastered. But what did “fuel flow” mean?
What was the difference between “sublight drive” and “super-light
drive”? Truly these were potent, though pagan, charms.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And so the sameness of days passed, and
after a time which felt like a century we observed that one star
was waxing in the screens. It swelled until it flamed big and
bright as our own sun. And then we saw a planet, similar to ours
save that it had two small moons. Downward we plunged, till the
scene was not a ball in the sky but a great rugged sweep of
landscape under our footsoles. When I saw heaven again turned blue,
I threw myself to the deck in thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The lock-bar snapped upward. The ship came
to a halt and hung where it was, a mile in the air. We had reached
Tharixan.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932252" id="_Toc66932252">Chapter VI</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger had summoned me to the control
turret, with Sir Owain and Red John, who led Branithar on a leash.
The bowman gaped at the screens and muttered horrid oaths.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Word had gone through the ship that all
fighting men must arm themselves. The two knights here were in
plate, their esquires waiting outside with shields and helmets.
Horses stamped in the holds and along the corridors. Women and
children huddled back with bright fearful eyes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Here we are!” Sir Roger grinned. It was
eldritch to see him so boyishly gay, when everyone else was
swallowing hard and sweating till the air reeked. But a fight, even
against the powers of hell, was something he could understand.
“Brother Parvus, ask the prisoner where we are on the planet.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I put the question to Branithar, who touched
a control button. A hitherto blank screen glowed to life, showing a
map. “We are where the cross hairs center,” he told us. “The map
will unroll as we fly about.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I compared the screen with the chart in my
hand. “The fortress called Ganturath seems to lie about a hundred
miles north by northeast, my lord,” I said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar, who had been picking up a little
English, nodded. “Ganturath is only a minor base.” He must put his
boasts into Latin still. “Yet numerous spaceships are stationed
there, and swarms of aircraft. The fire-weapons on the ground can
blast this vessel out of existence, and force screens will stop any
beams from your own guns. Best you surrender.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When I had translated, Sir Owain said
slowly: “It may be the wisest thing, my lord.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What?” cried Sir Roger. “An Englishman
yield without a fight?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But the women, sire, and the poor little
children!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I am not a rich man,” said Sir Roger. “I
cannot afford to pay ransom.” He clumped in his armor to the
pilot’s chair, sat down, and tapped the manual controls.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Through the downward vision screens, I saw
the land slide swiftly away beneath us. Its rivers and mountains
were of homelike shape, but the vegetation’s green hues were
overlaid with a weird bluish tint. The country seemed wild. Now and
again we saw a few rounded buildings, amidst enormous grain fields
cultivated by machines, but otherwise it was bare of man as the New
Forest. I wondered if this, too, were some king’s hunting preserve,
then remembered Branithar’s account of sparse habitation everywhere
in the Wersgor Empire.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A voice broke our silence, chattering away
in the harsh blue-face language. We started, crossed ourselves, and
glared about. The sounds came from a small black instrument affixed
to the main panel.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“So!” Red John drew his dagger. “All this
time there’s been a stowaway! Give me a crowbar, sire, and I’ll pry
him out.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar divined his meaning. Laughter
barked in the thick blue throat. “The voice is borne from afar, by
waves like those of light but longer,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Talk sense!” I demanded.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, we are being hailed by an observer at
Ganturath fortress.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger nodded curtly when I translated.
“Voices out of thin air are little compared to what we’ve already
seen,” he said. “What does the fellow want?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I could catch only a few words of the
challenge, but got the drift of it. Who were we? This was not the
regular landing place for scout craft. Why did we enter a forbidden
area? “Calm them,” I instructed Branithar, “and remember I will
understand if you betray</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He shrugged, as if amused, though his own
brow was also filmed with sweat. “Scoutship 587-Zin returning,” he
said. “Urgent message. Will halt above the base.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The voice gave assent, but warned that if we
came lower than a stanthax (about half a mile), we would be
destroyed. We were to hover until the crews of patrol aircraft
could board us.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By now, Ganturath was visible: a compact
mass of domes and half-cylinders, masonry over steel skeletons as
we later found out. It made a circle about a thousand feet in
diameter. Half a mile or so northward lay a smaller set of
buildings. Through a magnifying view screen, we saw that out of the
latter jutted the muzzles of huge fire-bombards.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Even as we came to a halt, a pale shimmering
sprang up around both parts of the fortress. Branithar pointed.
“The defensive screens. Your own shots would spatter harmlessly
off. It would be a lucky hit that melted one of those gun muzzles,
where they thrust out beyond the shield. But you are an easy
target.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Several egg-shaped metallic craft, like
ridges against the huge bulk of our Crusader, approached. We saw
others lift from the ground, the main part of the fortress. Sir
Roger’s fair head nodded. “’Tis as I thought,” he said. “Those
screens stop a fire-beam, mayhap, but not a material object, since
the boats pass through.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“True,” said Branithar by way of me. “You
might manage to drop an explosive missile or two, but the outlying
section, where the guns are, would destroy you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Aha.” Sir Roger studied the Wersgor with
eyes gone pale. “So you possess explosive shells, eh? Doubtless
aboard this very craft. And you never told me. We’ll see about that
later,” He jerked a thumb at Red John and Sir Owain. “Well, you two
have seen how the ground lies. Co back to the men, now, and be
ready to emerge fighting when we land.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">They departed, nervously eyeing the screens,
where the aircraft were very near us. Sir Roger put his own hands
on the wheels that controlled the bombards. We had learned, with
some experimentation, that those great weapons almost aimed and
fired themselves. As the patrol boats closed in, Sir Roger cut
loose.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Blinding hell-beams stabbed forth. They
wrapped the aircraft in flame. I saw the nearest one cut in two by
that fiery sword. Another tumbled red-hot, a third exploded.
Thunder boomed. Then all I saw was falling metal scrap.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger tested Branithar’s claims, but
they were true: his beams splashed off that pale, translucent
screen. He grunted. “I looked for that. Best we get down now before
they send up a real warship to deal with us, or open fire from the
outlying emplacement.” While he spoke, he sent us hurtling
groundward. A flame touched our hull, but then we were too low. I
saw Ganturath’s buildings rush up to meet me and braced myself for
death.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A ripping and crunching went through our
ship. This very turret burst open as it brushed a low lookout
tower. But the battlements of that were snapped off. Two thousand
feet long, incalculably heavy, the Crusader squashed half Ganturath
beneath itself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger was on his feet even before the
engines went dead. “Haro!” he bellowed. “God send the right!” And
off he went, across the canted, buckled deck. He snatched his
helmet from the terrified esquire and put it on as he strode. The
boy followed, teeth chattering but nonetheless in charge of the de
Tourneville shield.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar sat speechless. I gathered up my
robe and hurried off to find a sergeant who would lock up the
valuable captive for me. This being done, I was able to witness the
battle.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We had come down lengthwise rather than on
our tail, protected by the artificial weight generators from
tumbling around inside. Havoc encompassed us, smashed buildings and
sharded walls. A chaos of blue Wersgorix boiled from the rest of
the fortress.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By the time I got to the exit myself, Sir
Roger was out with all his cavalry. He didn’t stop to gather them,
but charged into the thick of the nearest enemies. His horse
neighed, mane flying, armor flashing; the long lance spitted three
bodies at once. When at length the spear was broken, my lord drew
his sword and hewed lustily. Most of his followers had no scruples
about unknightly weapons; they eked out blade, mace, and
morningstar with handguns from the ship.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Now archers and men-at-arms poured forth,
yelling. Belike it was their own terror that made them so savage.
They closed with the Wersgonix ere our foe could unleash many
lightning bolts. The battle became hand-to-hand, a leaderless riot,
where ax or dagger or quarterstaff was more useful than fire-beam
or pellet gun.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When the space about him was cleared, Sir
Roger reared on his black stallion. He clashed back his visor and
set bugle to lips. It shrieked through the din, summoning the
mounted force. These, better disciplined than the foot soldiers,
disengaged themselves from the immediate fray and joined the baron.
A mass of great horses, men like steel towers, blazoned shields and
flying plumes and lances aloft, formed behind my lord.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His gauntleted hand pointed to the outlying
fort, where the skyward bombards had ceased their futile shooting.
“That we must seize, ere they rally!” he cried. ‘After me,
Englishmen, for God and St. George!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He took a fresh shaft from his esquire,
spurred his charger, and began to pick up speed. The earthquake
roll of hoofs deepened behind him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Those Wersgorix stationed in the lesser fort
poured out to resist the attack. They had guns of several kinds,
plus small explosive missiles to be thrown by hand. They picked off
a couple of riders. But in that short distance there was no time
for more long-range shooting. And they were unnerved in any event.
There is no sight more terrifying than a charge of heavy
cavalry.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The trouble of the Wersgorix was that they
had gone too far. They had made combat on the ground obsolete, and
were ill-trained, ill-equipped, when it happened. True, they
possessed fire-beams, as well as force shields to stop those same
fire-beams. But they had never thought to lay down caltrops.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As it was, the frightful blow struck their
line, rolled over it, stamped it into mud, and continued without
even being slowed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One of the buildings beyond gaped open. A
small spaceship-though big as any seagoing vessel on Earth-had been
trundled forth. It stood on its tail, engine growling, ready to
take off and flame us from above. Sir Roger directed his cavalry
thither. The lancers hit it in a single line. Shafts splintered;
men were hurled from the saddle. But consider: a charging
cavalryman may bear his own weight of armor, and have fifteen
hundred pounds of horse beneath him. The whole travels at several
miles per hour. The impact is awesome.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The ship was bowled over. It fell on its
side and lay crippled.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Through and through the lesser fort, Sir
Roger’s horsemen ramped, sword, mace, spurred boot, and shod hoof.
The Wersgorix died like swatted flies. Or say rather, the flies
were the small patrol boats, buzzing overhead, unable to shoot into
that melee without killing their own folk. To be sure, Sir Roger
was killing their own folk anyway; but by the time the Wersgorix
realized that, they were too late.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Back in the main section where the Crusader
lay, the fight sputtered down into a question of slaying bluefaces
or talking them prisoner or chasing them into the near-by forest.
It was still one vast confusion, though, and Red John Hameward felt
he was wasting the skill of his longbowmen. He formed them into a
detachment and quick-stepped across open ground to aid Sir
Roger.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The patrol boats swooped low, hungrily. Here
was prey they might get. Their thin beams were intended for short
ranges. On the first pass, two archers died. Then Red John yelled
an order.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Suddenly the sky was full of arrows. A
cloth-yard shaft with a six-foot yew bow behind it will go through
an armored man and the horse beneath him. These little boats made
matters worse by flying directly into the gray goose flock. Not one
of them escaped. Riddled, their pilots quilled as hedgehogs, they
crashed. The archers roared and ran to join the fray ahead.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The spaceship which the lancers had knocked
over was still manned. Its crew must have recovered their wits.
Suddenly its gun turrets spurted flame, no mere handweapon beam but
thunderbolts that knocked down walls. A horseman and his steed,
caught in that fire, were instantly gone. Vengefully, the
lightnings raked around.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Red John picked up one end of a great steel
beam, part of the dome shattered by those bombards. Fifty men aided
him. They ran toward the entry port of the ship. Once, twice,
crash! Down came the door, and the English yeomen stormed
within.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Battle of Ganturath lasted for some
hours, but most of that time went merely to ferret out hidden
remnants of the garrison. When the alien sun smoldered westward,
there were about a score of English dead. None were badly wounded,
for the flame guns usually killed if they hit the mark at all. Some
three hundred Wersgorix were slain, roughly an equal number
captured; many of these latter were minus a limb or an ear. I would
guess that perhaps a hundred more escaped on foot. They would carry
word of us to the nearest estates-which, however, were not very
close by. Evidently the speed and destructiveness of our initial
attack had put Ganturath’s far-speakers out of action before the
alarm could go abroad.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our true disaster was not revealed till
later. We were not dismayed at having wrecked the ship we came in,
for we now had several other vessels whose aggregate volume would
hold us all. Their crews had never gotten a chance to man them.
However, in her atrocious landing, the Crusader had burst open her
control turret. And the Wersgor navigational notes therein were now
lost.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At the moment, all was triumph.
Red-splashed, pantMg, in scorched and dinted armor, Sir Roger de
Tourneville rode a weary horse back to the main fortress. After him
came the lancers, archers, yeomen- ragged, battered, shoulders
slumped with exhaustion. But the Te Deum was on their lips, rising
beneath the strange constellations that twinkled forth, and their
banners flew bravely against the sky.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It was wonderful to be an Englishman.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc66932253" id="_Toc66932253">Chapter VII</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We made camp at the nearly intact lesser
fort. Our people chopped wood from the forest, and as the two moons
rose, their blazes leaped up. Men sat close, faces picked out of
darkness by the homely unrestful light, waiting for the stewpots to
be ready. Horses cropped the native grass without enjoying its
taste. The captured Wersgorix huddled together under guard of
pikemen. They were stunned; this did not seem possible. I felt
almost sorry for them, godless and cruel though their dominion
was.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger summoned me to join his captains,
who were camped near one of the gun turrets. We manned what
defenses were available, against expected counterattack, and tried
not to wonder what new frightfulness the foe might have in their
armory.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Tents had been erected for the more wellborn
ladies. Most were abed, but Lady Catherine sat on a stool at the
edge of the firelight. She listened to our talk, and her mouth was
drawn into bleak lines.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The captains sprawled, weary, on the ground.
I saw Sir Owain Montbelle, idly thrumming his harp; scarred, fierce
old Sir Brian Fitz-William, the third of the three knighted men on
this voyage; big Alfred Edgarson, the purest of Saxon franklins;
gloomy Thomas Bullard, fingering the naked sword on his lap; Red
John Hameward, shy because he was the lowest born of them all. A
couple of pages poured wine.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My lord Sir Roger, the unbendable, was on
his feet, hands clasped behind his back. Having removed his armor
like the others, while leaving his clothes of pride in their chest,
he might have been the humblest of his own sergeants. But then one
saw the sine’~vy jut-nosed face and heard him talk. And spurs
jingled on his boots.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He nodded as I came into view. “Ah, there,
Brother Parvus. Sit down and have a stoup. You’ve a head on your
chine, and we need all good redes tonight.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A while longer he paced, brooding. I dared
not interrupt with my dreadful news. A medley of noises in the dark
deepened its twin-mooned otherness. These were not frogs and
crickets and nightjars of England: here was a buzz, a saw-toothed
hum, an inhumanly sweet singing like a lute of steel. And the odors
were alien, too, which disturbed me even more.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well,” said my lord. “By God’s grace, we’ve
won this first encounter. Now we must decide what to do next.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I think-“ Sir Owain cleared his throat,
then spoke hurriedly: “No, gentles, I am sure. God aided us against
unforeseeable treachery. He will not be with us if we show undue
pride. We’ve won a rare booty of weapons, with which we can
accomplish great things at home. Let us therefore start back at
once.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger tugged his chin. “I’d prefer stay
here,” he answered, “yet there’s much in what you say, my friend.
We can always come back, after the Holy Land is freed, and do a
proper job on this fiend’s nest.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Aye,” nodded Sir Brian. “We’re too alone
now, and encumbered with women and children and aged and livestock.
So few fighting men against a whole empire, that were madness.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yet I could like to break another spear
against these Wersgorix,” said Alfred Edgarson. “I haven’t won any
gold here yet.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Gold is no use unless we bring it home,”
Captain Bullard reminded him. “Bad enough campaigning in the heat
and thirst of the Holy Land. Here, we know not even what plants may
be poisonous, or what the winter season is like. Best we depart
tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A rumble of assent went up among them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I cleared my throat miserably. Branithar and
I had just spent a most unpleasant hour. “My lords-“ I began.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yes? What is it?” Sir Roger glared at
me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“My lords, I do not think we can find the
way home!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What?” They roared it out. Several leaped
to their feet. I heard Lady Catherine suck a horrified breath in
between her teeth.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Then I explained that the Wersgor notes on
the route to our sun were missing from the shattered control
turret. I had led a search party, scratching about everywhere in
the attempt to find them, but had no success. The interior of the
turret was blackened, melted in places. I could only conclude that
a stray fire-beam had come through the hole, played across a drawer
burst open by the violence of our landing, and cindered the
papers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But Branithar knows the way!” protested Red
John. “He sailed it himself! I’ll wring it out of him, my
lord.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Be not so hasty,” I counseled. “’Tis not
like sailing along a coastline, where every landmark is known.
There are uncounted millions of stars. This scouting expedition
zigzagged among them looking for a suit- able planet. Without
figures which the captain wrote down as they sailed, one might
spend a lifetime in search and not happen on our own sun.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But doesn’t Branithar remember?” yelped Sir
Owain. “Remember a hundred pages of numbers?” I responded. “Nay,
none could do that, and this is the more true since Branithar was
not the captain of the ship nor the one who kept track of her
wanderings and heaved the log and performed other navigational
duties, rather our captive was a lesser noble whose task was more
among the crewmen and in working with the demonic engines
than-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Enough.” Sir Roger gnawed his lip and
stared at the ground. “This changes things. Yes.... Was not the
Crusader’s route known in advance? Say by the duke who sent her
out?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No, my lord,” I said. “Wersgor scoutships
merely go off in any direction the captain likes and look at any
star he deems promising. Not till they come back and report does
their duke know where they have been.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A groan went up. Those were hardy men, but
this was enough to daunt the Nine Worthies. Sir Roger walked
stiffly over to his wife and laid a hand on her arm.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I’m sorry, my dear,” he mumbled.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She turned her face from him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain arose. The knuckles stood forth
pale on the hand that clutched his harp. “This have you led us to!”
he shrilled. “To death and damnation beyond the sky! Are you
satisfied?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger clapped hand on hilt. “Be still!”
he roared. “All of you agreed with my plan. Not a one of you
demurred. None were forced to come. We must all share the burden
now, or God pity us!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The younger knight muttered rebelliously but
sat down again.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It was awesome how swiftly my lord rebounded
from dismay to boldness. Of course it was a mask he put on for the
others’ benefit; but how many men could have done that much? Truly
he *as a peerless leader. I attribute it to the blood of King
William the Conqueror, a bastard grandson of whom wed an
illegitimate daughter of that Earl Godfrey who was later outlawed
for piracy, and so founded the noble de Tourneville house.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Come, now,” said the baron with a degree of
cheerfulness. “’Tis not so bad. We’ve but to act with steadfast
hearts, and the day shall yet be ours. Remember, we hold a good
number of captives, whom we can use as a bargaining point. If we
must fight again, we’ve already proven they cannot withstand us
under anything like equal conditions. I admit there are more of
them, and that they have more skill with these craven hell-weapons.
But what of that? ‘Twill not be the first time brave men properly
led have driven a seemingly stronger army from the field.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“At the very worst, we can retreat. We have
skyships enough, and can evade pursuit in the trackless deeps of
space. But I’m fain to stay here, bargain shrewdly, fight where
needful, and put my trust in Cod. Surely He, who stopped the sun
for Joshua, can swat a million Wersgorix if it pleases Him: for His
mercy endureth forever. After we’ve wrung terms from the foe, we’ll
make them find our home for us and stuff our ships with gold. I say
to you, hold fast! For the glory of God, the honor of England, and
the enrichment of us all!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He caught them up, bore them on the wave of
his own spirit, and had them cheering him at the end. They crowded
close, hands on his hands above his great shining sword, and swore
to remain true till the danger was past. Thereafter an hour went in
eager planning-most of it, alas, wasted, for God seldom brings that
to pass which man expects. Finally all went to their rest.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I saw my lord take his wife’s arm to lead
her into his pavilion. She spoke to him, a harsh whisper, she would
not hear his protests but stood there denouncing him in the enemy
night. The larger moon, already sinking, touched them with cold
fire.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger’s shoulders slumped. He turned and
went slowly from her, wrapped himself in a saddle blanket, and
slept in the dews of the field.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It was strange that a man among men was so
helpless against a woman. He had something beaten and pitiful about
him as he lay there. I thought it boded ill for us.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932254" id="_Toc66932254">Chapter VIII</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We had been too excited at first to pay
attention, and afterward we slept too long. But when I woke again,
finding it still dark, I checked the movement of stars against
trees. Ah, how slowly! The night here was many times as long as on
Earth.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This unnerved our folk badly enough in
itself. The fact that we did not flee (by now, it could no longer
be concealed that treason, rather than desire, had brought us
hither) puzzled many. But at least they expected weeks to carry out
whatever the baron decided. The shock, when enemy ships appeared
even before dawn, was great.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Be of good heart,” I counseled Red John, as
he shivered with his bowman in the gray mists. “’Tis not that they
have powers magical. You were warned of this at the captains’
council. ‘Tis only that they can talk across hundreds of miles and
fly such distances in minutes. So as soon as one of the fugitives
reached another estate, the word of us went abroad.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well,” said Red John, not unreasonably, “if
that’s not magic, I’d like to know what is.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“If magic, you need have no fear,” I
answered, “for the black arts do not prevail against good Christian
men. However, I tell you again, this is mere skill in the mechanic
and warlike arts.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And those do prevail against g-g-good
Christian men!” blubbered an archer. John cuffed him to silence,
while I cursed my own clumsy tongue.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In that wan, tricky light, we could see many
ships hovering, some of them as big as our broken Crusader. My
knees drummed under my cassock. Of course, we were all inside the
force screen of the smaller fort, which had never been turned off.
Our gunners had already discovered that the fire-bombards placed
here had controls as simple as any in the spaceship, and stood
prepared to shoot. However, I knew we had no true defense. One of
those very powerful explosive shells whereof I had heard hints
could be fired. Or the Wersgorix might attack on foot, overwhelming
us with sheer numbers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yet those ships did only hover, in utter
silence under the unknown stars. When at length the first pale
dawnlight streamed off their flanks, I left the bowmen and fumbled
through dew-wet grass to the cavalry. Sir Roger sat peering
heavenward from his saddle. He was armed cap-a-pie, helmet in the
crook of an arm, and none could tell from his face how little sleep
had been granted him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Good morning, Brother Parvus,” he said.
“That was a long darkness.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain, mounted close by, wet his lips.
He was pale. his large long-lashed eyes sunken in dark rims. ‘No
midwinter night in England ever wore away so slowly,” he said, and
crossed himself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The more daylight, then,” said Sir Roger.
He seemed almost cheerful, now when he dealt with foemen rather
than unruly womenfolk.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain’s voice cracked across like a dry
twig. “Why don’t they attack?” he yelled, “Why do they just wait up
there?’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It should be obvious. I never thought
‘twould need mentioning,” said Sir Roger. “Have they not good
reason to be afraid of us?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What?” I said. “Well, sire, of course we
are Englishmen. However-“ My glance traveled back, over the pitiful
few tents pitched around the fortress walls; over ragged, sooty
soldiers; over huddled women and grandsires, wailing children; over
cattle, pigs, sheep, fowl, tended by cursing serfs; over pots where
breakfast porridge bubbled- ‘However, my lord,” I finished, ‘at the
moment we look more French.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The baron grinned. “What do they know about
French and English? For that matter, my father was at Bannockburn,
where a handful of tattered Scottish pikemen broke the chivalry of
King Edward II. Now all the Wersgorix know about us is that we have
suddenly come from nowhere and-if Branithar’s boasts be true-done
what no other host has ever achieved: taken one of their
strongholds! Would you not move warily, were you their
constable?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The guffaw that went up among the horse
troopers spread down to the foot, until our whole camp rocked with
it. I saw how the enemy prisoners shuddered and shrank close
together when that wolfish noise smote them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As the sun rose, a few Wersgor boats landed
very slowly and carefully, a mile or so away. We held our fire, so
they took heart and sent out people who began to erect machinery on
the field.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Are you going to let them build a castle
under our very noses?” cried Thomas Bullard.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“’Tis less likely they’ll attack us, if they
feel a little more secure,” the baron answered. “I want it made
plain that we’ll parley.” His smile turned wry. “Remember, friends,
our best weapon now is our tongues.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Soon the Wersgorix landed many ships in a
circular formation-like those stonehenges which giants raised in
England before the Flood-to form a camp walled by the eerie faint
shimmer of a force screen, picketed by mobile bombards, and roofed
by hovering warcraft. Only when this was done did they send a
herald.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The squat shape strode boldly enough across
the meadows, though well aware that we could shoot him down. His
metallic garments were dazzling in the morning sun, but we
discerned his empty hands held open. Sir Roger himself rode forth,
accompanied by myself gulping Our Fathers on a palfrey.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgor shied a trifle, as the huge
black stallion and the iron tower astride it loomed above him. Then
he gathered a shaky breath and said, “If you behave yourselves, I
will not destroy you for the space of this discussion.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger laughed when I had fumblingly
translated. “Tell him,” he ordered me, “that I in turn will hold my
private lightnings in check, though they are so powerful I can’t
swear they may not trickle forth and blast his camp to ruin if he
moves too swiftly.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But you haven’t any such lightnings at your
command, sire,” I protested. “It wouldn’t be honest to claim you
do.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You will render my words faithfully and
with a straight face, Brother Parvus,” he said, “or discover
something about thunderbolts.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I obeyed. In what follows I shall as usual
make no note of the difficulties of translation. My Wersgor
vocabulary was limited, and I daresay my grammar was ludicrous. In
all events, I was only the parchment on which these puissant ones
wrote, erased, and wrote again. Aye, in truth I felt like a
palimpsest ere that hour was done.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Oh, the things I was forced to say! Above
all men do I reverence that valiant and gentle knight Sir Roger de
Tourneville. Yet when he blandly spoke of his</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">English estate-the small one, which only
took up three planets-and of his personal defense of Roncesvaux
against four million paynim, and his singlehanded capture of
Constantinople on a wager, and the time guesting in France when he
accepted his host’s invitation to exercise the droit de seigneur
for two hundred peasant weddings on the same day-and more and
more-his words nigh choked me, though I am accounted well versed
both in courtly romances and the lives of the saints. My sole
consolation was that little of this shameless mendacity got through
the language difficulties, the Wersgor herald understanding merely
(after a few attempts to impress us) that here was a person who
could outbiuster him any day of the week.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Therefore he agreed on behalf of his lord
that there would be a truce while matters were discussed in a
shelter to be erected midway between the two camps. Each side might
send a score of people thither at high noon, unarmed. While the
truce lasted, no ships were to be flown within sight of either
camp.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“So!” exclaimed Sir Roger gaily, as we
cantered back. “I’ve not done so ill, have I?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“K-k-k-k,” I answered. He slowed to a
smoother pace, and I tried again: “Indeed, sire, St. George-or more
likely, I fear, St. Dismas, patron of thieves- must have watched
over you. And yet-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yes?” he prompted me. “Be not afraid to
speak your mind, Brother Parvus.” With a kindness wholly unmerited:
“Ofttimes I think you’ve more head on those skinny shoulders than
all my captains lumped together.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Well, my lord,” I blurted, “you’ve wrung
concessions from them for a while. As you foretold, they are being
cautious whilst they study us. And yet, how long can we hope to
fool them? They have been an imperial race for centuries. They must
have experience of many strange peoples living under many different
conditions. From our small numbers, our antiquated weapons, our
lack of home-built spaceships, will they not soon deduce the truth
and attack us with overwhelming force?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His lips thinned. He looked toward the
pavilion which housed his lady and children.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Of course,” he said. “I hope but to stay
their hand a short while.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And what then?” I pursued him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I don’t know.” Whirling on me, fierce as a
stooping hawk, he added: “But ‘tis my secret, d’ you understand? I
tell it to you as if in confession. Let it come out, let our folk
know how troubled and planless I truly am ... and we’re all
done.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I nodded. Sir Roger struck spurs to his
horse and galloped into camp, shouting like a boy.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932255" id="_Toc66932255">Chapter IX</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">During the long wait before Tharixan reached
its noontide, my master summoned his captains to a council. A
trestle table was erected before the central building, and there we
all sat.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“By God’s grace,” he said, “we’re spared
awhile. You’ll note that I’ve even made them land all their ships.
I’ll wrangle to win us as much more respite as may be. That time
must be put to use. We must strengthen our defenses. Also, we’ll
ransack this fort, seeking especially maps, books, and other
sources of information. Those of our men who’re at all gifted in
the mechanic arts must study and test every machine we find, so
that we can learn how to erect force screens and fly and otherwise
match our foes. But all this has to be done secretly, in places
hidden from enemy eyes. For if ever they learn we don’t already
know all about such implements-“ He smiled and drew a finger across
his throat.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Good Father Simon, his chaplain, turned a
little green. “Must you?” he said faintly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger nodded at him. “I’ve work for you,
too. I shall need Brother Parvus to interpret Wersgor for me. But
we have one prisoner, Branithar, who speaks Latin-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I would not say that, sire,” I interrupted.
“His declensions are atrocious, and what he does to irregular verbs
may not be described in gentle company.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nevertheless, until he’s mastered enough
English, a cleric is needed to talk to him. You see, he must
explain whatever our students of the captured engines do not
understand, and must interpret for any other Wersgor prisoners whom
we may question.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ah, but will he do so?” said Father Simon.
“He is a most recalcitrant heathen, my son, if indeed he has any
soul at all. Why, only a few days ago on the ship, in hopes of
softening his hard heart, I stood in his cell reading aloud the
generations from Adam to Noah, and had scarcely gotten past Jared
when I saw that he had fallen asleep!’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Have him brought hither,” commanded my
lord. “Also, find One-Eyed Hubert and tell him to come in full
regalia.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While we waited, talking in hushed voices,
Alfred Edgarson noticed how I sat quiet. “Well, now, Brother
Parvus,” he boomed, “what ails you? Methinks you’ve little to fear,
being a godly fellow. Even the rest of us, if we conduct ourselves
well, have naught to fear but a sweating time in Purgatory. And
then we’ll join St. Michael at sentry-go on heaven’s walls. Not
so?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I was loath to dishearten them by voicing
what had occurred to me, but when they insisted, I said, “Alas,
good men, worse may already have befallen us.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well?” barked Sir Brian Fitz-William. “What
is it? Don’t just sit there sniveling!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We had no sure way to tell time on the
voyage hither,” I whispered. “Hourglasses are too inaccurate, and
since reaching this devil-made place we’ve neglected even to turn
them. How long is the day here? What time is it on our earth?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Brian looked a trifle blank. “Indeed, I
know not. What of it?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I presume you had a haunch of beef to break
your fast,” I said. “Are you sure it is not Friday?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">They gasped and regarded each other with
round eyes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“When is it Sunday?” I cried. “Will you tell
me the date of Advent? How shall we observe Lent and Easter, with
two moons morris-dancing about to confuse the issue?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Thomas Bullard buried his face in his hands.
“We’re ruined!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger stood up. “No!” he shouted into
the strickenness. “I’m no priest, nor even very godly. But did not
Our Lord himself say the Sabbath was made for man and not man for
the Sabbath?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Father Simon looked doubtful. “I can grant
special dispensations under extraordinary circumstances,” he said,
“but I am really not sure how far I can strain such powers.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I like it not,” mumbled Bullard. “I take
this to be a sign that Cod has turned His face from us, withdrawing
the due times of the fasts and sacraments.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger grew red. He stood a moment more,
watching the courage drain from his men like wine from a broken
cup. Then he calmed himself, laughed aloud, and cried:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Did not Our Lord command His followers to
go forth as far as they were able, bringing His word, and He would
be with them always? But let’s not bandy texts. Perhaps we are
venially sinning in this matter. Well, if that be so, a man should
not grovel but should make amends. We’ll make costly offerings in
atonement. To get the means for such offerings ... have we not the
entire Wersgor Empire to hand, to squeeze for a ransom till its
yellow eyes pop? This proves that God Himself has commanded us to
this war!” He drew his sword, blinding in the daylight, and held it
before him hilt uppermost. “By this, my knightly sigil and arm,
which is also the sign of the Cross, I vow to do battle for God’s
glory!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He tossed the weapon so it swung glittering
in the hot air, caught it again and swung it so it shrieked. “With
this blade will I fight!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The men gave him a rather feeble cheer. Only
glum Bullard hung back. Sir Roger leaned down to that captain, and
I heard him hiss: “The clinching proof of my reasoning is, that
I’ll cut anyone who argues further into dogmeat.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Actually, I felt that in his crude way my
master had gasped truth. In my spare time I would recast his logic
into proper syllogistic form, to make sure; but meanwhile I was
much encouraged, and the others were at least not demoralized.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Now a man-at-arms fetched Branithar, who
stood glaring at us. “Good day,” said Sir Roger mildly, through me.
“We shall want you to help interrogate prisoners and instruct us in
our studies of captured engines.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgor drew himself up with a warrior’s
pride. “Save your breath,” he spat. “Behead me and be done with it.
I misjudged your capabilities once, and it has cost many lives of
my people. I shall not betray them further.’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger nodded. “I looked for such an
answer,” he said. ‘What became of One-Eyed Hubert?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Here I am, sire, here I am, here’s good old
Hubert,” and the baron’s executioner hobbled up, adjusting his
hood. The ax was tucked under one scrawny arm, and the noosed rope
laid around his hump. “I was only wandering about, sire, picking
flowers for me youngest grandchild, sire. You know her, the little
girl with long gold curls and she’s so honeysweet fond o’ daisies.
I hoped I could find one or other o’ these paynim blooms might
remind her o’ our dear Lincolnshire daisies, and we could weave a
daisy chain together-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I’ve work for you,” said Sir Roger.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ah, yes, sire, yes, yes, indeed.” The old
man’s single rheumy eye blinked about, he rubbed his hands and
chuckled. “Ah, thank you, sire! ‘Tis not that I mean to criticize,
that ain’t old Hubert’s place, and he knows his humble place, him
who has served man and boy, and his father and grandsire afore him,
executioners to the noble de Tournevilles. No, sire, I knows me
place and I keeps it as Holy Writ commands. But Cod’s truth, you’ve
kept poor old Hubert very idle all these years. Now your father,
sire, Sir Raymond, him we called Raymond Red-Hand, there was a man
what appreciated art! Though I remember his father, your grandsire,
me lord, old Nevil Rip-Talon, and his justice was the talk o’ three
shires. In his day, sire, the commons knew their place and
gentlefolk could get a decent servant at a decent wage, not like
now when you let ‘em off with a fine or maybe a day in the stocks.
Why, ‘tis a scandal-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Enough,” said Sir Roger. “The blueface here
is stubborn. Can you persuade him?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, sire! Well, well, well!” Hubert
sucked toothless gums with a pure and simple delight. He walked
around our rigid captive, studying him from all angles, “Well,
sire, now this is another matter, ‘tis like the good old days come
back, ‘tis, yes, yes, yes, Heaven bless my good kind master! Now o’
course I took little equipment with me, only a few thumbscrews and
pincers and suchlike, but it won’t take me no time, sire, to knock
together a rack. And maybe we can get a nice kettle of oil. I
always says, sire, on a cold gray day there ain’t nothing so cozy
as a glowing brazier and a nice hot kettle of oil. I think o’ my
dear old daddy and I gets tears in this old eye, yes, sire,
that</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I do. Let me see, let me see,
tum-te-tum-te-tum.” He began measuring Branithar with his rope.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgor flinched away. His smattering of
English was enough to give him the drift of conversation. “You
won’t!’ he yelled. “No civilized folk would ever-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Now let’s just see your hand, if you
please.” Hubert took a thumbscrew from his pouch and held it
against the blue fingers. “Yes, yes, ‘twill fit snug and proper.”
He unpacked an array of little knives. “Sumer is icumen in,” he
hummed, “ihude sing cucu.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar gulped. “But you’re not
civilized,” he said weakly. Choking and snarling: “Very well. I
will do it. Curse you for a pack of beasts! When my people have
smashed you, it will be my turn!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I can wait,” I assured him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger beamed. But suddenly his face fell
again. The deaf old executioner was still counting over his
apparatus. “Brother Parvus,” said my lord, “would you could you. .
. break the news to Hubert? I confess I’ve not the heart to tell
him.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I consoled the old fellow with the thought
that if Branithar were caught lying, or otherwise failing to give
us honest help, there would be punishment. This sent him hobbling
happily off to construct a rack. I told Branithar’s guard to make
sure the Wersgor saw that work.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932256" id="_Toc66932256">Chapter X</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At last it came time for the conference.
Since most of his important followers were occupied with the study
of enemy materials, Sir Roger made out a full score for his party
by taking their ladies along in their finest clothes. Otherwise
only a few unarmed troopers, in borrowed court panoply, accompanied
him and me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As they rode across the field toward that
pergola-like structure which a Wersgor machine had erected in an
hour between the two camps, of some shimmering pearly material, Sir
Roger said to his wife: “I would not take you into peril like this
if I had any choice. ‘Tis only that we must impress them with our
power and wealth.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Her face remained stony, turned from him
toward the vast, sinister columns of grounded ships. “I will be no
more endangered there, my lord, than are my children back in the
pavilion.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“God’s name!” he groaned. “I was wrong. I
should have left that cursed vessel alone and sent word to the
King. But will you hold my mistake against me all our lives?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“They will not be long lives, thanks to your
mistake,” she said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He bridled. “You swore at the wedding-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh, yes. Have I not kept my oath? I have
refused you no obedience.” Her cheeks flamed. “But God alone may
command my feelings.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I won’t trouble you any more,” he said
thickly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This I did not hear myself. They rode ahead
of us all, the wind tossing their scarlet cloaks, his plumed bonnet
and the veils on her conical headdress, like a picture of the
perfect knight and his love. But I set it down here, conjecturally,
in light of the evil luck which followed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Being of gentle blood, Lady Catherine
controlled her manner. When we drew up at the meeting place, her
delicate features showed only a cold scorn, directed at the common
foe. She took Sir Roger’s hand and dismounted cat-graceful. He led
the way more clumsily, with stormy brows.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Inside the curtained pergola was a round
table, encircled by a kind of cushioned pew. The Wersgor chiefs
filled one half, their snouted blue faces unreadable to us but
their eyes flickering nervously. They wore metal-mesh tunics with
bronze insignia of rank. In silk and vair, golden chains, ostrich
plumes, cordovan hose, slashed and puffed sleeves, curl-toed shoes,
the English showed like peacocks in a hen yard. I could see that
the aliens were taken aback. The contrasting plainness of my
friar’s habit jarred them all the worse.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I folded my hands, standing, and said in the
Wersgor tongue, ‘For the success of this parley, as well as to seal
the truce, let me offer a Paternoster.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“A what?” asked the chief of the foe. He was
somewhat fat, but dignified and with a strong visage.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Silence, please.” I would have explained,
but their abominable language did not seem to have any word for
prayer; I had asked Brarnthar. “Pater noster, qui est in coelis,” I
began, while the other English knelt with me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard one of the Wersgorix mutter: “See, I
told you they are barbarians. It’s some superstitious ritual.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I’m not so sure,” answered the chief
dubiously. “The Jairs of Boda, now, have certain formulas for
psychological integration. I’ve seen them temporarily double their
strength, or stop a wound from bleeding, or go days without sleep.
Control of inner organs via the nervous system.... And in spite of
all our own propaganda against them, you know the Jairs are as
scientific as we.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard these clandestine exchanges readily
enough, yet they did not seem aware of my awareness. I remembered
now that Branithar had seemed a little deaf, too. Evidently all
Wersgorix had ears less acute than men. This, I learned
subsequently, was because their home planet had denser air than
Terra, which made them wont to hear sounds more loudly. Here on
Tharixan, with air about like England, they must raise their voices
to be heard. At the time, I accepted God’s gift thankfully, without
stopping to wonder why nor to warn the foe.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Amen,” I finished. We all sat down at the
table.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger stabbed the chief with bleak gray
eyes. “Am I dealing with a person of suitable rank?” he asked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I translated. “What does he mean by ‘rank’?”
the head Wersgor wondered. “I am the governor of this planet, and
these are the primary officers of its security forces.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“He means,” I said, “are you sufficiently
well-born that he will not demean himself by treating with
you?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">They looked still more bewildered. I
explained the concept of gentle birth as well as I could: which,
with my limited vocabulary, was not well at all. We must thresh it
over for quite some time before one of the aliens said to his
lord:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I believe I understand, Grath Huruga. If
they know more than we do about the art of breeding for certain
traits-“ I must interpret many words new to me from context-“then
they may have applied it to themselves. Perhaps their entire
civilization is organized as a military force, with these carefully
bred super-beings in command.” He shuddered at the thought. “Of
course, they wouldn’t waste time talking to any creature of less
intelligence.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Another officer exclaimed, “No, that’s
fantastic! In all our explorations, we’ve never found-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We have touched only the smallest fragment
of the Via Galactica so far,” Lord Huruga answered. “We dare not
assume they are less than they claim to be, until we have more
information.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I, who had sat listening to what they
believed were whispers, favored them with my most enigmatic
smile.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The governor said to me: “Our empire has no
fixed ranks, but stations each person according to merit. I,
Huruga, am the highest authority on Tharixan.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Then I can treat with you until word has
reached your emperor,” said Sir Roger through me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I had trouble with the word “emperor.”
Actually, the Wersgor domain was like nothing at home. Most
wealthy, important persons dwelt on their vast estates with a
retinue of blueface hirelings. They communicated on the far-speaker
and visited in swift aircraft or spaceships. Then there were the
other classes I have mentioned elsewhere, such as warriors,
merchants, and politicians. But no one was born to his place in
life. Under the law, all were equal, all free to strive as best
they might for money or position. Indeed, they had even abandoned
the idea of families. Each Wersgor lacked a surname, being
identified by a number instead in a central registry. Male and
female seldom lived together more than a few years. Children were
sent at an early age to schools, where they dwelt until mature, for
their parents oftener thought them an encumbrance than a
blessing.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yet this realm, in theory a republic of
freemen, was in practice a worse tyranny than mankind has known,
even in Nero’s infamous day.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgorix had no special affection for
their birthplace; they acknowledged no immediate ties of kinship or
duty. As a result, each individual had no one to stand between him
and the all-powerful central government. In England, when King John
grew overweening, he clashed both with ancient law and with vested
local interests; so the barons curbed him and thereby wrote another
word or two of liberty for all Englishmen. The Wersgor were a
lickspittle race, unable to protest any arbitrary decree of a
superior. “Promotion according to merit” meant only “promotion
according to one’s usefulness to the imperial ministers.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But I digress, a bad habit for which my
archbishop has often been forced to reprove me. I return, then, to
that day in the place of nacre, when Huruga turned his terrible
eyes on us and said: “It appears there are two varieties of you.
Two species?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No,” said one of his officers. “Two sexes,
I’m sure. They are clearly mammals.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ah, yes.” Huruga stared at the gowns across
the table, cut low in shameless modern modes. “So I see.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When I had rendered this for Sir Roger, he
said, “Tell them, in case they are curious, that our womenfolk
wield swords side by side with men.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ah.” Huruga pounced on me. “That word
sword. Do you mean a cutting weapon?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I had no time to ask my master’s advice. I
prayed inwardly for steadiness and answered, “Yes. You have
observed them on our persons in camp. We find them the best tool
for hand-to-hand combat. Ask any survivor of the Ganturath
garrison.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Mmm . . . yes.” One of the Wersgorix looked
grim. “We have neglected the tactics of infighting for centuries,
Grath Huruga. There seemed no need for them. But I do remember one
of our unofficial border clashes with the Jairs. It was out on Uloz
IV, and they used long knives to wicked effect.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“For special purposes ... yes, yes.” Huruga
scowled. “However, the fact remains that these invaders prance
around on live animals-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Which need not be fueled, Grath, save by
vegetation.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘But which could not endure a heat beam or a
pellet. They wave weapons out of the prehistoric past. They come
not in their own ships, but in one of ours-“ He broke off his
murmur and barked at me:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“See here! I’ve delayed long enough. Yield
to our judgment, or we shall destroy you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I interpreted. “The force screen protects us
from your flame weapons,” said Sir Roger. “If you wish to attack on
foot, we shall make you welcome.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga turned purple. “Do you imagine a
force screen will stop an explosive shell?” he roared. “Why, we
could lob just one, let it burst inside your screen, and wipe out
every last creature of you!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger was less taken aback than I.
“We’ve already heard rumors of such bursting weapons,” he said to
me. “Of course, he’s trying to frighten us with the talk of a
single shot being enough. No ship could lift so great a mass of
gunpowder. Does he take me for a yokel who’ll believe any tinker’s
yarn? However, I grant he could fire many explosive barrels into
our camp.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“So what shall I tell him?” I asked
fearfully.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The baron’s eyes gleamed. “Render this very
exactly, Brother Parvus: ‘We are holding back our own artillery of
this sort because we wish to talk with you, not merely kill you. If
you insist on bombarding us, though, please commence. Our defenses
will thwart you. Remember, however, that we are not going to keep
our Wersgor prisoners inside those defenses!’”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I saw that this threat shook them. Even
these hard hearts would not willingly kill some hundreds of their
own people. Not that the hostages we held would stop them forever;
but it was a bargaining point, which might gain us time. I wondered
how we could possibly use that time, though, save to prepare our
souls for death.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, now,” huffed Huruga, “I didn’t imply
I was not ready to hear you out. You have not yet told us why you
have come in this unseemly, unprovoked manner.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It was you who attacked us first, who had
never harmed you,” answered Sir Roger. “In England we give no dog
more than one bite. My king dispatched me to teach you a
lesson.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga: “In one ship? Not even your own
ship?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger: “I do not believe in bringing
more than is necessary.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga: “For the sake of argument, what are
your demands?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger: “Your empire must make submission
to my most puissant lord of England, Ireland, Wales, and
France.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga: “Let us be serious, now.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger: “I am serious to the point of
solemnity. But in order to spare further bloodshed, I’ll meet any
champion you name, with any weapons, to settle the issue by single
combat. And may God defend the right!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga: “Are you all escaped from some
mental hospital?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger: “Consider our position. We’ve
suddenly discovered you, a heathen power, with arts and arms akin
to ours though inferior. You could do a certain amount of harm to
us, harassing our shipping or raiding our less firmly held planets.
This would necessitate your extermination, and we’re too merciful
to enjoy that. The only sensible thing is to accept your
homage.’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga: ‘And you honestly expect to-A hatful
of beings, mounted on animals and swinging swords-
bub-bub-bub-bub—“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He went into colloquy with his officers.
“This confounded translation problem!” he complained. “I’m never
sure if I’ve understood them aright. They could be a punitive
expedition, I suppose. For reasons of military secrecy, they could
have used one of our own ships and kept their most potent weapons
in reserve. It doesn’t make sense. But neither does it make sense
that barbarians would blandly tell the most powerful realm in the
known universe to surrender its autonomy. Unless it’s mere bluster.
But we may be completely misunderstanding their demands ... and
thereby misjudging them, perhaps to our own serious loss. Hasn’t
anyone got any ideas?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Meanwhile I said to Sir Roger, “You aren’t
serious about this, my lord?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Lady Catherine could not resist saying: “He
would be.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nay.” The baron shook his head. “Of course
not. What would King Edward do with a lot of unruly bluefaces? The
Irish are bad enough. Nay, I hope only to let myself be bargained
down. If we can wring from them some guarantee to let Terra
alone-and perhaps a few coffers of gold for ourselves-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And guidance home,” I said gloomily.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“That’s a riddle we must think on later,” he
snapped. “No time now. Certainly we dare not admit to the enemy
that we’re waifs.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga turned back to us. “You must realize
your demand is preposterous,” he said. “However, if you can
demonstrate that your realm is worth the trouble, our emperor will
be glad to receive an ambassador from it.’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger yawned and said languidly, through
me:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Spare your insults. My monarch will receive
your emissary, perhaps, if that person adopts the true Faith.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What is this Faith?” asked Huruga, for
again I must use an English word.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The true belief, of course,” I said. “The
facts about Him who is the source of all wisdom and righteousness,
and to whom we humbly pray for guidance.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What’s he babbling about now, Crath?”
muttered an officer.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I don’t know,” Huruga whispered back.
“Perhaps these, uh, English maintain some kind of giant computing
engine to which they submit the important questions for
decision.... I don’t know. Confounded translation problem! Best we
delay awhile. Watch them, their behavior; mull over what we’ve
heard.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And dispatch a message to Wersgorixan?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No, you fool! Not yet, not till we know
more. Do you want the main office to think we can’t handle our own
problems? If these really are mere barbarian pirates, can you
imagine what would happen to all our careers if we called in the
whole navy?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga turned to me and said aloud: “We have
ample time for discussion. Let us adjourn until tomorrow, and think
well in the meantime on every implication.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger was glad of that. “Let’s make
certain of the truce terms, though,” he added.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I was getting more facility in the Wersgor
language with every hour, so I was soon able to elucidate that
their concept of a truce was not ours. Their insatiable hunger for
land made them the enemy of all other races, so they could not
imagine a binding oath exchanged with anyone not blue and
tailed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The armistice was no formal agreement at
all, but a statement of temporary mutual convenience. They declared
that they did not at present find it expedient to fire on us, even
when we grazed our kine beyond the force screen. This condition
would prevail as long as we refrained from attacking any of them
who moved about in the open. For fear of espionage and missile
dropping, neither side wished the other to fly within view of the
camps, and would shoot at any vessel which lifted. That was all.
They would surely violate this if they decided it was to their
interest; they would work us harm if they saw any method of doing
so; and they expected us to feel likewise.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“They have the better of it, sire,” I
mourned. “All our flying craft are here. Now we can’t even jump
into our spaceships and flee; they’d pounce ere we could elude
pursuit. Whereas they have many other ships, elsewhere on the
planet, which may hover freely beyond the horizon and be ready to
assail us when the time comes.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nevertheless,” said Sir Roger, “I perceive
certain advantages. This business of neither giving nor expecting
pledges-aye—“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It suits you,” murmured Lady Catherine.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He whitened, leaped to his feet, bowed at
Huruga, and led us out.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932257" id="_Toc66932257">Chapter XI</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The long afternoon allowed our people to
make considerable progress. With Branithar to instruct them, or to
interpret for those prisoners who understood the art in question,
the English soon mastered the controls of many devices. They
practiced with spaceships and small flying vessels, being careful
to raise these only a few inches off the ground, lest the foe
observe it and shoot. They also drove about in horseless wagons;
they learned to use far-speakers, magnifying optical devices, and
other esoterica; they handled weapons that threw fire, or metal, or
invisible stunning beams. Of course we English had, as yet, no
inkling of the occult knowledge which had gone into making such
things. But we found them childishly simple to use. At home, we
harnessed animals, wound intricate crossbows and catapults, rigged
sailing ships, erected machines by which human muscles might raise
heavy stones. This business of twisting a wheel or pulling a lever
was naught in comparison. The only real difficulty was for
unlettered yeomen to remember what the symbols on the gauges stood
for-and this, indeed, was no more complicated a science than
heraldry, which any hero-worshiping lad could rattle off in
detail.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Being the only person with pretensions to
reading the Wersgor alphabet, I busied myself with papers seized in
the fortress offices. Meanwhile Sir Roger conferred with his
captains and directed the most oafish serfs, who could not learn
the new weapons, in certain construction work. The slow sunset was
burning, turning half the sky gold, when he summoned me to his
council board.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I seated myself and looked at those gaunt
hard faces. They were animated with fresh hope. My tongue clove to
my mouth. Well I knew these captains. Most of all did I know how
Sir Roger’s eyes danced- when hell was being hatched!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Have you learned what and where the
principal castles of this planet are, Brother Parvus?” he asked
me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yes, sire,” I told him. “There are but
three, of which Ganturath was one.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I can’t believe that!” exclaimed Sir Owain
Montbelle. “Why, pirates alone would-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You forget there are no separate kingdoms
here, or even separate fiefs,” I answered. “All persons are
directly subservient to the imperial government. The fortresses are
only lodging for the sheriffs, who keep order among the populace
and collect the taxes. True, these fortresses are also supposed to
be defensive bases. They include docks for the great star ships,
and warriors are stationed there. But the Wersgorix have fought no
true war for a long time. They’ve merely bullied helpless savages.
None of the other star-traveling races dare declare open war on
them; only now and then does a skirmish occur on some remote
planet. In short, three fortresses are ample for this whole
world.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“How strong are they?” snapped Sir
Roger.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“There is one hight Stularax, on the other
side of the globe, which is about like Ganturatfr. Then there is
the main fortress, Darova, where this proconsul Huruga dwells. That
one is by far the largest and strongest. I daresay it supplied most
of the ships and warriors we see facing us.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Where is the next world inhabited by
bluefaces?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“According to a book I studied, about twenty
lightyears hence. Wersgorixan itself, the capital planet, is much
farther off than that-farther away than Terra, even.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But the far-speaker would inform their
emperor at once of what’s happened, would it not?” asked Captain
Bullard.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No,” I said. “The far-speaker acts only as
fast as light. Messages between the stars must go by spaceship,
which means that it would take a brace of weeks to inform
Wersgorixan. Not that Huruga has done so. I overheard him speak to
one of his court, to say they would keep this affair secret
awhile.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Aye,” said Sir Brian Fitz-Wilhiam. “The
duke will seek to redeem himself for what we have done, by crushing
us unaided ere he reports anything whatsoever. ‘Tis a common enough
way of thinking.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“If we hurt him badly enough, though, he II
scream for help,” prophesied Sir Owain.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Just so,’ agreed Sir Roger. “And I’ve
thought of a way to hurt him!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I realized gloomily that when my tongue had
cloven to my mouth it knew what it was doing.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“How can we fight?” asked Bullard. “We’ve no
amount of devil-weapons to compare with what sits out on yon field.
If need be, they could ram us, boat for boat, and count it no great
loss.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“For which reason,” Sir Roger told him, “I
propose a raid on the smaller fort, Stularax, to gain more weapons.
‘Twill also jar Huruga out of his confidence.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Or jar him into attacking us.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“’Tis a chance we must take. Come worst to
worst, I’m not altogether terrified of another fight. See you not,
our only chance is to act with boldness.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There was no great demurral. Sir Roger had
had hours in which to jolly his folk. They were ready enough to
accept his leadership again. But Sir Brian objected sensibly: “How
can we effect any such raid? Yon castle lies thousands of miles
hence. We cannot flit thither from our camp without being fired
upon.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain raised mocking brows. “Maybe
you’ve a magic horse?” He smiled at Sir Roger.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘No. Another sort of beast. Hearken to me..
.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">That was a long night’s work for the yeomen.
They put skids under one of the smaller spaceboats, hitched oxen to
it, and dragged it forth as quietly as might be. Its passage across
open fields was disguised by driving cattle around it, as if
grazing them. Under cover of darkness, and by God’s grace, the ruse
was sufficient. Once beneath the tall thick-crowned trees, with a
screen of scouts who moved like shadows to warn of any blue
soldiers-“They had the practice for it, poaching at home,” said Red
John-the work was safer but also more hard. Not until nearly dawn
was the boat several miles from camp, so far off that it could lift
without being seen from Huruga’s field headquarters.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Though the largest vessel which could
possibly be moved thus, it was still too small to carry the most
formidable weapons. However, Sir Roger had during the day examined
the explosive shells fired by certain types of gun. He had had it
explained to him by a terrified Wersgor engineer, how to arm the
fuse thereon, so that it would go off on impact. The boat carried
several of these-also a disassembled trebuchet which his artisans
had constructed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Meanwhile, everyone not toiling with this
was set to work strengthening our camp defenses. Even women and
children were given shovels. Axes rang in the near-by forest. Long
as the night was, it seemed even longer when we labored thus
exhaustingly, stopping only to snatch a piece of bread or a wink of
sleep. The Wersgorix observed that we were busy-it could not be
avoided-but we tried to conceal from them what we actually did,
lest they see we were merely ringing the lesser half of Ganturath
with stakes, pits, caltrops, and chevaux-de-frise. When morning
came, with full daylight, our installations were hidden from view
by the long grass.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I myself welcomed such backbreaking labor as
a surcease from my fears. Yet my mind must worry them, like a dog
with a bone. Was Sir Roger mad? There seemed to be so many things
he had done awry. Yet, to each successive question, I found only
the same answer as himself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Why had we not fled the moment we possessed
Ganturath, instead of waiting till Huruga arrived and pinned us
down? Because we had lost the way home and had no chance whatsoever
of finding it without the help of skilled space sailors. (If it
could be found at all.) Death was better than a blind blundering
among the stars-where our ignorance would soon kill us anyway.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Having gained a truce, why did Sir Roger run
the gravest risk of its immediate breach by this attack on
Stularax? Because it was plain the truce could not last very long.
Given time to ponder what he had observed, Huruga must see through
our pretensions and destroy us. Thrown off balance by our boldness,
he might well continue to believe us more powerful than was the
truth. Or if he elected to fight, we should have our hands
strengthened by whatever arms were seized in the forthcoming
raid.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But did Sir Roger seriously expect so mad a
plan to succeed? Only God and himself could answer that. I knew he
was improvising as he went along. He was like a runner who stumbles
and must all at once run even faster so as not to fall.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But how splendidly he ran!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">That reflection soothed me. I committed my
fate to Heaven and shoveled with a more peaceful heart.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Just before dawn, as mist streamed among
buildings and tents and long-snouted fire-bombards, under the first
thin light creeping up the sky, Sir Roger saw his raiders off. They
were twenty: Red John with the best of our yeomen, and Sir Owain
Montbelle as chief. It was curious how that knight’s often faint
heart always revived at the prospect of action. He was almost gay
as a boy when he stood there wrapped in a long scarlet cloak,
listening to his orders.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Go through the woods, keeping well under
cover, to where the boat lies,” my lord told him. “Wait till noon,
then fly off. You know how to use those unrolling maps for guide,
eh? Well, then, when you come to this Stularax place-‘twill take an
hour or so if you fly at what seems a reasonable speed hereabouts-
land where you have cover. Give it a few shells from the trebuchet
to reduce the outer defenses. Dash in afoot, while they’re still
confused; seize what you can from the arsenals, and return. If all
is still peaceful hereabouts, lie quietly. If fighting has broken
out, well, do what seems best.’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Indeed, sire.” Sir Owain clasped his hand.
That gesture was not fated to occur between them again.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As they stood there under darkling skies, a
voice called: “Wait.” All the men turned their faces toward the
inner buildings, where mist smoked thickly. Out of it came the Lady
Catherine.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I have only now heard you were going,” she
said to Sir Owain. “Must you-twenty men against a fortress?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Twenty men-“ He bowed, with a smile that
lit his face like the sun-“and myself, and the memory of you, my
lady!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The color crept up her pale countenance. She
walked past a stone-stiff Sir Roger, to the younger knight, till
she stood gazing up at him. All saw that her hands bled. She held a
sword in them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“After I could no more lift a spade this
night,” she whispered, “I helped twine bowstrings. I can give you
no other token.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain accepted it in a great silence.
Having laid it within his shirt of chain mail, he kissed her
scarred small fingers. Straightening, his cloak aswirl about him,
he led his yeomen into the forest.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger had not moved. Lady Catherine
nodded a little. “And you are going to sit at table today with the
Wersgorix?” she asked him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She slipped away in the fog, back toward the
pavilion which he no longer shared. He waited until she was quite
out of sight before following.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932258" id="_Toc66932258">Chapter XII</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our people made good use of the long morning
to rest themselves. By now I could read Wersgor clocks, though not
precisely sure how their units of time compared to Terrestrial
hours. At high noon I mounted my paifrey and met Sir Roger to go to
the conference. He was alone. “Methought we were to be a score,” I
faltered.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His countenance was wooden. “No more reason
for that,” he said. “It may go ill for us in yon rendezvous, when
Huruga learns of the raid. I’m sorry I must hazard you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I was sorry, too, but wished not to spend
time in self-pity which could be more usefully devoted to telling
my beads.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The same Wersgor officers awaited us within
the any curtains. Huruga looked his surprise as we trod in. Where
are your other negotiators? he asked sharply. “At their prayers,” I
replied, which was belike true enough.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“There goes that word again,” grumbled one
of the blueskins. ‘What does it mean?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Thus.” I illustrated by saying an Ave and
marking it off on my rosary.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Some kind of calculating machine, I think,”
said another Wersgor, “It may not be as primitive as it looks on
the outside, either.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But what does it calculate?” whispered a
third one, his ears raised straight up with uneasiness.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga glared. This has gone far enough,” he
snapped. “All night you were at work over there. If you plan some
trick-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Don’t you wish you had a plan?” I
interrupted in my most Christianly sweet voice.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As I hoped, this insolence rocked him back.
We sat down.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">After chewing on it a moment, Huruga
exclaimed: “About your prisoners. I am responsible for the safety
of residents of this planet. I cannot possibly treat with creatures
who hold Wersgorix captive. The first condition of any further
negotiations must be their immediate release.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“’Tis a shame we cannot negotiate, then,”
said Sir Roger via myself. “I don’t really want to destroy
you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘You shall not leave this place until those
captives are delivered to me,” said Huruga. I gasped. He smiled
coldly. “I have soldiers on call, in case you, too, brought
something like this.” He reached in his tunic and pulled out a
pellet-throwing handgun. I stared down the muzzle and gulped.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger yawned. He buffed his nails on a
silken sleeve. “What did he say?” he asked me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I told him. “Treachery,” I groaned. “We were
all supposed to be unarmed.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Nay, remember no oaths were sworn. But tell
his disgrace Duke Huruga that I foresaw this chance, and carry my
own protection.” The baron pressed the ornate seal ring on his
finger, and clenched his fist. “I have cocked it now. If my hand
unclasps for any reason before ‘tis uncocked again, the stone will
burst with enough force to send us all flying past St. Peter.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Through clattering teeth, I got this
mendacious message out. Huruga sprang to his feet. “Is this true?”
he roared.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I-i-indeed it is,” I said. “B-b-by Mahomet
I swear it.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The blue officers huddled together. From
their frantic whispers I gathered that a bombshell as tiny as that
sealstone was possible in theory, though no race known to the
Wersgorix were skillful enough to make one.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Calm prevailed at last. “Well,” said Huruga,
“it looks like an impasse. I myself think you’re lying, but do not
care to risk my life.” He slipped the little gun back in his tunic.
“However, you must realize this is an impossible situation. If I
can’t obtain the release of those prisoners myself, I shall be
forced to refer this whole matter to the Imperium on
Wersgorixan.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You need not be so hasty,” Sir Roger told
him. “We’ll keep our hostages carefully. You may send chirurgeons
to look after their health. To be sure, we must ask you to
sequestrate all your armament, as a guarantee of good faith. But in
return, we’ll mount guard against the Saracens.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The what?” Huruga wrinkled his bony
forehead.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The Saracens. Heathen pirates. You’ve not
encountered them? I find that hard to believe, for they range
widely. Why, at this very minute a Saracen ship could be descending
on your own planet, to pillage and burn-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga jerked. He pulled an officer aside
and whispered to him. This time I could not follow what was said.
The officer hurried out.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Tell me more,” said Huruga.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“With pleasure.” The baron leaned back in
his seat. at cross-legged ease. I could never have achieved his
calm. As nearly as I could gauge, Sir Owain’s boat must now be at
Stularax; for recall how much slower this conversation was than I
have written it, with all the translation, the pauses to explain
some uncomprehended word, the search for a telling phrase.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yet Sir Roger spun out his yarn as if he had
eternity. He explained that we English had fallen so savage! upon
the Wersgorix because their unprovoked attac led us to think they
must be new allies of the Saracens. Now that we understood
otherwise, it was possible that in time England and Wersgorixan
could reach agreement, alliance against this common menace.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The blue officer dashed back inside. Through
the door flap I saw soldiery in the alien camp hurrying to their
posts; a roar of awakening machines came to my ears.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well?” Huruga barked at his underling.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Reports-the far-speaker—outlying homes saw
bright flash-Stularax gone-must have been a shell of the
superpowered type-“ The fellow blurted it out between his
pantings.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger exchanged a look with me as I
translated. Stularax gone? Utterly destroyed?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our aim had only been to retrieve some more
weapons, especially light portable ones for our men-at-arms. But if
everything had vanished in smoke...</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger licked dry lips. “Tell him the
Saracens must have landed, Brother Parvus,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga gave me no chance. Breast heaving
with wrath, amber eyes turned blood-red, he stood shaking, pulled
out his handgun again and screamed: “No more of this farce! Who
else was with you? How many more spaceships have you?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger uncoiled himself, till he loomed
above the stumpy Wersgorix like an oak on a heath. He grinned,
touched his signet ring meaningfully, and said: “Well, now, you
can’t expect me to reveal that. Perhaps I’d best return to my camp,
till your temper has cooled.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I could not phrase it so smoothly in my
halting words. Huruga snarled: “Oh, no! Here you stay!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I go.” Sir Roger shook his close-cropped
head. “Incidentally, if for any reason I don’t return, my men have
orders to kill all the prisoners.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga heard me out. With a self-mastery I
admired, he replied: “Go, then. But when you are back, we shall
attack you. I do not propose to be caught between your camp on the
ground and your friends in the sky.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The hostages,” Sir Roger reminded him.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We shall attack,” repeated Huruga doggedly.
“It will be entirely with ground forces-partly to spare those same
prisoners, and partly, of course, because every spaceship and
aircraft must get aloft and search for those attackers of Stularax.
We will also refrain from using high-explosive weapons, lest we
destroy the captives. But-“ He stabbed a finger down upon the
table. “Unless your weapons are far superior to what I think, we
will overwhelm you with sheer numbers, if nothing else. I don’t
believe you even have any armored wagons, only a few light ground
cars captured at Ganturath. Remember, after the battle, such of
your folk as survive will be our prisoners. If you have harmed a
single one of those Wersgorix you hold, your people will die, very
slowly. If you yourself are caught alive, Sir Roger de Tourneville,
you will watch all of them die before you do yourself.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The baron heard me render this for him. The
lips were very pale in his sunburned face. “Well, Brother Parvus,”
he said in rather a small voice, “it’s not worked out as well as I
hoped-though perhaps not quite as badly as I feared. Tell him that
if he will indeed let us two return safely, and confine his attack
to ground forces, and avoid high-explosive shells, our hostages
shall be safe from anything but his own fire.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He added wryly: “I don’t think I could have
made myself butcher helpless captives anyhow. But you need not tell
him that.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga merely jerked his head, an icy
gesture, when I gave him the message. We two humans left, swung
into the saddle and turned back. We held our horses to a walk, to
prolong the truce and the feel of sunlight on our faces.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What happened at that Stularax castle,
sire?” I whispered.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I know not,” said Sir Roger. “But I’ll
hazard that the blue-faces spoke truly-and I didn’t believe it!-
when they said one of their more powerful shells could wipe out an
encampment. So the weapons we hoped to steal are gone. I can only
pray that our poor raiders were not also caught in the blast. Now
we can but defend ourselves.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He raised his plumed head. “Yet Englishmen
have ever fought best with their backs to the wall.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc66932259" id="_Toc66932259">Chapter XIII</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So we rode into camp, and my lord shouted
haro as if this battle had been his dearest wish. In a great iron
clangor, our folk went to their stations.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Let me describe our situation more fully. As
a minor base, Ganturath was not built to withstand the most
powerful forces of war. The lesser portion, which we occupied,
consisted of several low masonry buildings arranged in a circle.
Outside that circle were the armored emplacements of the
fire-bombards; but these, being meant only to shoot upward at
skycraft, were useless to us now. Underground was a warren of rooms
and passages. There we put our children, aged, prisoners, and
cattle, in charge of a few armed serfs. Such older people, or
others not fit for combat, as were spry enough, waited near the
middle of the buildings, prepared to carry off the wounded, fetch
beer, and otherwise aid the fighting line.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This line stood on the side facing the
Wersgor camp, just within the low earthen wall erected during the
night. Their pikes, bills, and axes were reinforced at intervals by
squads of bowmen. The cavalry poised at either wing. Behind them
were the younger women and certain untrained men, who shared out
our all too few pellet weapons; the force screen made fire guns
useless.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Around us shimmered the pale heat-lightning
of that shield. Behind us rose the ancient forest. Before us,
bluish grass rippled down the valley, isolated trees soughed, and
clouds walked above the distant hills. It all had the eerie
loveliness of a landscape in Faerie. Preparing bandages with the
aboveground noncombatants, I wondered why there must be hatred and
killing in so sweet a realm.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Flying craft thundered skyward and out of
sight from the Wersgor camp. Our gunners dropped a few ere they
were all gone. A number remained on the ground, held in reserve.
They included some of the very largest transport ships. At the
moment, however, my chief interest was the ground.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Wersgorix streamed forth, armed with
long-barreled pellet weapons and in well-ordered squads. They did
not advance in close ranks but scattered as much as possible. Some
of our folk let out a cheer at this, but I knew it must be their
ordinary ground-fighting tactics. When one has deadly rapid-fire
guns, one does not attack in solid masses. Rather, one employs
devices to take the enemy’s guns out of action.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Such engines were in fact present. Doubtless
they had been flown hither from the central bastion of Darova.
There were two kinds of these horseless warwagons. The most
numerous sort was light and open, made of thin steel, holding four
soldiers and a couple of rapid-fire weapons. They ran immensely
fast and agile, like water beetles on four wheels. As I saw them
whip and scream about, bouncing at a hundred miles an hour over
broken terrain, I understood their purpose: to be so difficult to
hit that most of them could work up to the very bombards of the
foe.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, these small cars hung back,
‘covering the Wersgor infantry. The first line of actual attack was
the heavy-armored vehicles. These moved but slowly for a powered
machine, no faster than a horse could gallop. This was because of
their size-big as a peasant’s cottage-and the thick steel plating
which could withstand all but a direct shellburst. With bombards
projecting from their turrets, with their roaring and dust, they
were like unto dragons. I counted more than twenty: massive,
impervious, grinding forward on treads in a wide line. Where they
had passed, grass and earth were smashed into stone-hard ruts.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I am told that one of our gunners, who had
learned how to use the wheeled cannon which threw explosive shells,
broke ranks and dashed for such a weapon. Sir Roger himself, now
armed cap-a-pie, rode up and knocked him asprawl with his lance.
‘Hold on, there!” rapped the baron. “What’re you about?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘To shoot, sire,” gasped the soldier. “Let’s
fire at ‘em ere they break over our wall and-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“If I didn’t think our good yew bows could
deal with such overgrown snails, I’d have you priming yon tube,”
said my lord. “But as it is, back to your pike!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It had a salutary effect on the badly shaken
spearmen, who stood with weapons grounded to receive that frightful
charge. Sir Roger saw no reason to explain that (judging from what
had happened at Stularax) he dared not use explosives at such short
range, lest he destroy us, too. Of course, he should have realized
that the Wersgorix would have many kinds of shell of graded
potency. But who can think of everything at once?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As it was, the drivers of those moving
fortresses must have been sorely puzzled that we did not fire on
them, and wondered what we held in reserve. They found out when the
first war-wagon toppled into one of our covered pits.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Two more were similarly trapped ere it was
understood that these were no ordinary obstacles. Surely the good
saints had aided us. In our ignorance, we had dug holes broad and
deep, which by themselves would not have been escape-proof for such
powerful vehicles. But then we added great wooden stakes, almost by
sheer habit, as if we expected to impale outsize horses. Some of
these caught in the treads which girdled the wheels, and erelong
those wheels were jammed tight with wood pulp.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Another wagon evaded the pits, which were
not continuous. It approached the breastworks. A rapidfire gun spat
from it, seeking the range, and stitched small craters along our
earth wall. ‘God send the right!” roared Sir Brian Fitz-William.
His horse spurted from our lines, closely followed by half a dozen
of the nearer cavalrymen. They galloped in a semicircle, just
beyond reach of the gun. The vehicle lumbered in pursuit, seeking
to bring its smallest-bore cannon to bear. Sir Brian got it headed
the way he desired, winded his war-horn, and galloped back to
shelter as the wagon plunged into a hole.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The war-turtles drew back. In that long
grass, and with our cunning camouflage, they had no way of knowing
where the other traps were. And these were the only such machines
on all Tharixan, not to be lightly hazarded. We English had
trembled lest they continue. Only one would have had to get through
to wipe us out.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Even though his information about us, our
powers, and our possible spaceborne reinforcements was scanty, I
think Huruga should have ordered the heavy wagons onward. Indeed,
the Wersgor tactics were deplorable in all respects. But remember
that for a long time they had not fought seriously on the ground.
Their conquest of backward planets was a mere battue; their
skirmishes with rival starfaring nations were mostly aerial.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Thus Huruga, discouraged by our pits but
heartened by our failure to use low-power sheilfire, withdrew the
great cars. Instead, he sent the infantry and the light vehicles
against us. His idea was plainly for them to find a path between
our traps and mark it for the giant machines to follow.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The blue soldiers came at a run, scarcely
visible through the tall grass, divided into little squads. I
myself, being placed far back, saw only the occasional flash of a
helmet and the poles which they stuck up here and there to mark a
safe channel for the heavy wagons. Yet I knew they numbered many
thousands. My heart thudded within me, and my mouth longed for a
beaker of ale.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Ahead of the soldiers came racing the light
cars. A few of them went into pits and at such speeds were horribly
wrecked. But most sped in a straight line straight into the stakes
we had planted in the grass near our breastworks, in case of a
cavalry charge.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So fast were they traveling, the cars were
almost as vulnerable to such a defense as horses would be. I saw
one rise in the air, turn over, smash back to earth, and bounce
twice ere it broke apart. I saw another impale itself, spout liquid
fuel, and burst into flame. I saw a third swerve, skid, and crash
into a fourth.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Several more, escaping the abatis, ran over
the caltrops we had scattered around. The iron spikes entered the
soft rings encircling their wheels and were not to be gotten out. A
car so injured could at best limp feebly from the battle.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Commands in the harsh Wersgor tongue must
have rattled over the far-speaker. The majority of the open cars,
still unscathed, ceased to mill about. They drew into a loose but
orderly formation, and advanced at a walking pace.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Snap! went our catapults and crash! went our
ballistic. Bolts, stones, and pots of burning oil hailed
atrociously among the advancing vehicles. Not many were thus
disabled, but their line wavered and slowed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Then our cavalry charged.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A few of our horsemen died, caught in a
storm of lead. But they had not far to gallop to reach the enemy.
Also, the grass fires started by our oil pots confused Wersgor
vision with their heavy smoke. I heard a clang and boom as lances
burst against iron sides, then had no more chance to watch that
struggle. I know only that the lancers failed to disable any car
with their shafts. However, it startled the drivers so much that
these often failed completely to defend themselves against what
followed. Rearing horses brought down hoofs, to crumple the thin
steel plates; a few quick swipes of ax, mace, or sword emptied a
vehicle of its crew. Some of Sir Roger’s men used handguns to good
effect, or small round shells which burst and scattered jagged
fragments when thrown after a pin was released. The Wersgorix had
similar weapons, of course, but less determination to use them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The last cars fled in terror, hotly pursued
by the English riders. “Come back, there! bellowed Sir Roger at
them. He shook the fresh lance given him by his esquire. “Come
back, you caitiff rogues! Stand and deliver, you base-born
heathen!” He must have been a splendid sight, gleaming metal and
fluttering plumage and blazoned shield upon the restless coalblack
stallion. But the Wersgorix were not a knightly folk. They were
more prudent and forethoughtful than we. It cost them dearly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our horsemen must quickly retreat, for now
the blue foot was close, firing their guns as they pulled into
larger masses for the assault on our breastworks. Armor was no
protection, only a bright target. Sir Roger bugled his men to
follow him, and they scattered out onto the plain.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgorix set up a defiant cheer and
rushed. Across the seething confusion of our camp, I heard the
archer captains howl their command. Then the gray goose flock went
skyward with a noise as of mighty winds.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It came down, gruesomely, among the
Wersgorix. While the first arrow flight was still rising, the
second was on its way. A shaft with so much force behind it pierces
the body and comes out on the other side with its broad cutting
head all bloody. And now the crossbows, slower but still more
powerful, began to mow down the nearest attackers. I think that
during those last few moments of their charge, the Wersgorix must
have lost half their folk.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Nonetheless, dogged almost as Englishmen,
they ran on to our very wall. And here our common men-at-arms stood
to receive them. The women fired and fired, pinning down a goodly
part of the foe. Those who came so close that guns were useless,
must face ax, spear, bilihook, mace, morningstar, dagger, and
broadsword.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Despite their awesome losses, the Wersgorix
still outnumbered our folk two or three to one. Yet it was scarcely
fair. They had no body armor. Their only weapon for such close-in
fighting was a knife attached to the muzzle of the handgun, to make
a most awkward spear ... or the gun itself, clubbed. A few did
carry pellet-firing sidearms, which caused us some casualties. But
as a rule, when John Blueface fired at Harry Englishman, he missed
even at pointblank range, in all that turmoil. Before John could
fire again, Harry had laid him open with a halberd.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When our cavalry returned, striking the
Wersgor infantry from the rear and hewing away, it was the end. The
enemy broke and ran, trampling his own comrades in blind horror.
The riders chased them, with merry hunting calls. When they were
far enough away, our longbows cut loose once more.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Still, many escaped who must otherwise have
been spitted on a lance, for Sir Roger saw the heavy wagons
trundling vengefully back and retreated with his folk By God s
mercy, I was so occupied caring for the wounded fetched to me that
I knew nothing of that moment when our leaders thought we were
undone after all. For the Wersgor charge had not gone for naught.
It had succeeded in showing the turtle-cars how to avoid our pits.
And now the iron giants came across a field turned into red mud,
and naught we knew could stop them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Thomas Bullard’s shoulders slumped where he
sat mounted near the baronial pennon. ‘Well,” he sighed, “we gave
what was ours to give. Now who will ride out with me to show them
how Englishmen can die?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger’s weary face drew into grave
lines. “We’ve a harder task than that, friends,” he said. “We were
right to hazard our lives on a chance of victory. Now that we see
defeat upon us, we’ve no right to throw those lives away. We must
live-as slaves, if need besot that our women and babes are not
altogether alone on this hell-world.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“God’s bones!” shouted Sir Brian
Fitz-William. “Are you gone craven?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The baron’s nostrils flared. “You heard me,”
he said. “We stay here.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And then-b! It was as if God Himself had
come to deliver His poor sinful partisans. Brighter than lightning,
a blue-white flash burst, several miles off in the forest. So lurid
was the radiance that those few who chanced to be looking in that
direction were blind for hours afterward. No doubt a great many
Wersgorix were thus incapacitated, since their army faced it. The
roar that followed knocked riders from their saddles and men from
their feet. A wind swept us all, furnace hot, and carried tents
before it like blown rags. Then, as that shattering wrath departed,
we saw a cloud of dust and smoke arise. Shaped like an evil
mushroom it towered almost to heaven. Minutes passed before it
began to dissipate; its upper clouds lingered for hours.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The charging war-cars ground to a halt. They
knew, as we did not, what that burst signified. It was a shell of
the ultimate potency, that destruction of matter which I cannot but
feel to this day is an impious tampering with God’s work, though my
archbishop has cited me Scriptural texts to prove that any art is
lawful if it be used for good purposes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This was not a very strong shell, as such
weapons go. It was meant to annihilate a half-mile circle, and
produced comparatively little of those subtle poisons which
accompany such explosions. And it had been fired distantly enough
from the scene of action to harm no one.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yet it put the Wersgorix in a cruel dilemma.
If they used a similar weapon to wipe out our camp-if they overran
us by any means-they might expect a hail of death. For the hidden
bombard would have no further reason to spare the area of
Ganturath. Thus they must suspend their assault upon us, until they
had found and dealt with this new enemy.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Their war-wagons lumbered back. Most of the
aircraft they had in reserve lifted and scattered widely, searching
for whoever had fired that shell. The chief implement of this
search was (as we knew from our own studies) a device embodying the
same forces as are found in lodestone. Through powers which I do
not understand, and have no desire to understand since the
knowledge is unessential to salvation if not smacking of the black
arts, this device could smell out large metallic masses. A gun big
enough to fire a shell of the known potency should have been
discovered by any aircraft flitting within a mile of its hiding
place.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yet no such gun could be located. After a
tense hour, while we English watched and prayed on our walls, Sir
Roger gusted a deep breath.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I don’t want to seem ungrateful,” he said,
“but I do believe God’s helped us through Sir Owain, rather than
directly. We ought to find his party somewhere out in the woods,
even if those enemy flyers don’t seem able to. Father Simon, you
must know who the best poachers are in your parish-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh, my son!” exclaimed the chaplain.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger grinned. “I ask for no secrets of
the confessional. I’m only telling you to appoint a few shall we
say, skilled woodsmen? .. . to sneak their way through the grass
into yon forest. Have them locate Sir Owain, wherever he is, and
order him to hold his fire till I send word. You needn’t tell me
who you appoint, Father.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘In that case, my son, it shall be as you
command.” The priest drew me aside and asked me to give spiritual
comfort to the injured and frightened as his locum tenens, while he
led a small scout party into the forest.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But my lord found another task for me. He
and I and an esquire rode out under a white banner toward the
Wersgor camp. We assumed the foe would have wit enough to
understand our meaning, even if they did not use the same truce
signal. And thus it was. Huruga himself drove out in an open car to
meet us. His blue jowls looked shrunken, and his hands
trembled.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I call upon you to yield,” said the baron.
“Stop forcing me to destroy your poor benighted commoners. I pledge
you’ll all be treated fairly and allowed to write home for ransom
money.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I, yield to a barbarian like you?” croaked
the Wersgor. Just because you have some ... some confounded
detection-proof cannon-no!” He paused. “But to get rid of you, I’ll
allow you to leave in the spaceships you’ve seized.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Sire. I gasped when I had translated this,
“have we indeed won escape?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Hardly,” Sir Roger answered. “We can’t find
our way back, remember; and as yet, we dare not ask for a skilled
navigator to help us, or we’d reveal our weakness and be attacked
again. Even if we did somehow win home, ‘twould still leave this
nest of devils free to plot a renewed assault on England. Nay, I
fear that he who mounts a bear cannot soon dismount.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So with a heavy heart, I told the blue noble
that we had come for more than some of his shoddy, oldfashioned
spaceships, and if he did not surrender we would be forced to
devastate his land. Huruga snarled for reply and drove back.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We also returned. Presently Red John
Hameward came from the forest with Father Simon’s party, which he
had encountered on his way to our camp.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We flew to that Stularax castle openly,
sire,” he related. “We saw other sky-boats, but none challenged us,
taking us for a simple ship o’ their own. Still, we knew no
fortress sentries’d let us land without some questions. So we put
down in some woods, a few miles from the keep. We set up our
trebuchet and put one o’ those bursting shells in’t. Sir Owain’s
idea was to lob a few to shake up their outer defenses. Then we’d
slip closer afoot, leaving a crew to fire some more shells when we
was near and break down their walls. We expected the garrison’d be
scurrying about in search of our engine, so we could slip in, kill
whatever guards were left behind, lift what we could carry from
their arsenal, and return to our boat.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At this point, since it is no longer used, I
had best explain the trebuchet. It was the simplest but in many
ways the most effective siege engine. In principle it was only a
great lever, freely swinging on some fulcrum. A very long arm ended
in a bucket for the missile, while the short arm bore a stone
weight, often of several tons. This latter was raised by pulleys or
a winch, while the bucket was loaded. Then the weight was released,
and in falling it swung the long arm through a mighty arc.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I didn’t think much o’ those shells we
had,” Red</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">John went on. “Why, the things didn’t weigh
no more’n five pounds. We’d trouble rigging the trebuchet to cast
em only those few miles. And what could they do, I wondered, but
burst with a pop? I’ve seen trebuchets used proper, laying siege to
French cities. We’d throw boulders of a ton or two, or sometimes
dead horses, over the walls. But, well, orders was orders. So I
myself cocked the little shell like I’d been told how to, and we
let fly. Whoom! The world blew up, like. I had to admit this was
even better to throw nor a dead horse.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, through the magnifying screens we
could see the castle was pretty much flattened. No use raiding it
now. We lobbed a few more shells to make sure it were reduced
proper. Nothing there now but a big glassy pit. Sir Owain reckoned
as we was carrying a weapon more useful nor any which we could o’
lifted, and I’d say he were right. So we landed in the woods some
miles hence and dragged the trebuchet forth and set it up again.
That’s what took us so long, m’ lord. When Sir Owain had seen from
the air what was happening about that time, we fired a shell just
to scare the enemy a bit. Now we’re ready to pound ‘em as much as
you wish, sire.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But the boat?” asked Sir Roger. “The foe
have metal-sniffers. That’s why they haven’t found your trebuchet
in the forest: it s made of wood. But surely they could discover
your flying boat, wherever you’ve hid it.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh, that, sire.” Red John grinned. “Sir
Owain’s got our boat flitting up there ‘mongst t’others. Who’s to
tell the difference in yon swarm?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger whooped laughter. “You missed a
glorious fight,” he said, “but you can light the balefire. Go back
and tell your men to start shelling the enemy camp.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We withdrew underground at the agreed-on
moment, as shown on captured Wersgor timepieces. Even so, we felt
the earth shudder, and heard the dull roaring, as their ground
installations and most of their ground machines were destroyed. A
single shot was enough. The survivors thereof stormed in blind
terror aboard one of the transport ships, abandoning much perfectly
unharmed equipment. The lesser sky-craft were even quicker to
vanish, like blown sea scud. As the slow sunset began to burn in
that direction we had wistfully named the west, England’s leopards
flew above England’s victory.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932260" id="_Toc66932260">Chapter XJV</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain landed like some hero of a chanson
come to earth. His exploits had not required much effort of him.
While buzzing around in the middle of the Wersgor air fleet, he had
even heated water over a brazier and shaved. Lithely now he walked,
head erect, mailcoat shining, red cloak aflutter in the wind. Sir
Roger met him near the knightly tents, battered, filthy, reeking,
clotted with blood. His voice was hoarse from shouting. “My
compliments, Sir Owain, on a most gallant action.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The younger man swept him a bow-and changed
it most subtly to Lady Catherine’s, as she emerged from our
cheering thron~. “I could have done no less,” murmured Sir Owain,
‘with a bowstring about my heart.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The color mounted to her face. Sir Roger’s
eyes flickered from one to another. Indeed, they made a fair
couple. I saw his hands clench on the haft of his nicked and
blunted sword.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Go to your tent, madame,” he told his
wife.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“There is still work to do among the
wounded, sire,” she answered.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You’ll work for anyone but your own husband
and children, eh?” Sir Roger made an effort to sneer, but his lip
was puffy where a pellet had glanced off the visor of his helmet.
“Go to your tent, I say.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain looked shocked. “Those are not
words to address a gentlewoman with, sire,” he protested.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“One of your plinking roundels were better?”
grunted Sir Roger. “Or a whisper, to arrange an assignation?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Lady Catherine grew quite pale. She took a
long breath before words came. Silence fell upon those persons who
stood within earshot. “I call God to witness that I am maligned,”
she said. Her gown streamed with the haste of her stride. As she
vanished into her pavilion, I heard the first sob.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain stared at the baron with a kind of
horror. “Have you lost your senses?” he breathed at last.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger hunched thick shoulders, as if to
raise a burden. ‘Not yet. Let my captains of battle meet with me
when they’ve washed and supped. But it might be wisest, Sir Owain,
if you would take charge of the camp guard.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The knight bowed again. It was not an
insulting gesture, but it reminded us all how Sir Roger ha
transgressed good manners. He departed and took up his duties
briskly. A watch was soon set. Thereafter Sir Owain took Branithar
on a walk around the blasted Wersgor camp, to examine that
equipment which had been far enough away to remain usable, The
blueface had-even during the past few busy days-picked up more
English. He talked, lamely but with great earnestness, and Sir
Owain listened. I glimpsed this in the last dim twilight, as I
hurried to the conference, but could not hear what was being
said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A fire burned high, and torches were stuck
in the ground. The English chieftains sat around the trestle table
with alien constellations winking to life overhead. I heard night
sough in the forest. All the men were deathly tired, they slumped
on the benches, but their eyes never left the baron.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger stood up. Bathed, clad in fresh
though plain garments, a sapphire ring arrogant on one finger, he
betrayed himself only by the dullness of his tone. Though the words
were brisk enough, his soul was not in them. I glanced toward the
tent where Lady Catherine and his children lay, but darkness hid
it.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Once again,” said my lord, “God’s grace has
aided us to win. In spite of all the destruction we wrought, we’ve
more booty of cars and weapons than we can use. The army that came
against us is broken, and only one fortress remains on this entire
world!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Brian scratched his white-bristled chin.
“Two can play that game of tossing explosives about,” he said.
“Dare we remain here? As soon as they recover their wits, they’ll
find means to fire on us.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“True.” Sir Roger’s blond head nodded.
“That’s one reason we must not linger. Another being that it’s an
uncomfortable dwelling place at best. By all accounts, the castle
at Darova is far larger, stronger, and better fitted. Once we’ve
seized it, we need not fear shellfire. And even if Duke Huruga has
no means left him whereby to bombard us here, we can be sure he’s
now swallowed his pride and sent spaceships off to other stars for
help. We can look for a Wersgor armada to come against us.” He
affected not to notice the shudder that went among them, but
finished, “For all these reasons, we want Darova for our own,
intact.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“To stand off the fleets of a hundred
worlds?” cried Captain Bullard. “Nay, now, sire, your pride has
curdled and turned to madness. I say, let’s get aloft ourselves
while we can, and pray God that He will guide us back to
Terra.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger struck the table with his fist.
The noise cracked across all forest rustlings. “God’s wounds!” he
roared. “On the day of a victory such as hasn’t been known since
Richard the Lion Heart, you’d tuck tail between legs and run! I
thought you a man!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Bullard growled deep in his throat, “What
did Richard gain in the end, save a ransom payment that ruined his
country?” But Sir Brian Fitz-William heard him and muttered low,
“I’ll hear no treason.” Bullard realized what he had said, bit his
lip and fell silent. Meanwhile Sir Roger hastened on:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The arsenals of Darova must have been
stripped for the assault on us. Now we have nearly all which
remains of their weapons, and we’ve killed off most of its
garrison. Give them time, and they’ll rally. They’ll summon
franklins and yeomen from all over the planet, and march against
us. But at this moment, they must be in one hurly-burly. The best
they’ll be able to do is man the ramparts against us. Counterattack
is out of the question.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“So shall we sit outside Darova’s walls till
their reinforcements come?” gibed a voice in the shadows.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Better that than sit here, think you not?”
Sir Roger’s laugh was forced, but a grim chuckle or two responded.
And so it was decided.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our worn-out folk got no sleep. At once they
must start their toil, by the brilliant double moonlight. We found
several of the great transport aircraft which had been only
slightly damaged, being on the fringes of the blast. The artisans
among our captives repaired them at spearpoint. Into these we
rolled all the weapons and vehicles and other equipment we could.
People, prisoners, and cattle followed. Well before midnight, our
ships had lumbered into the sky, guarded by a cloud of other
vessels with one or two men aboard each. We were none too soon.
Hardly an hour after our departure-as we learned later-unmanned
flyers loaded with the strongest explosives rained down upon the
site of Ganturath.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A cautious pace, through heavens empty of
hostile craft, brought us over an inland sea. Miles beyond it, in
the middle of a rugged and thickly forested region, we raised
Darova. Having been summoned to the control turret to interpret, I
saw it in the vision screens, far ahead and far below but magnified
to our sight.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We had flown to meet the sun, and dawn
glowed pink behind the buildings. These were only ten, low, rounded
structures of fused stone, their walls thick enough to withstand
almost any blow. They were knitted together with reinforced
tunnels. Indeed, nearly all that castle was deep underground, as
self-contained as a spaceship. I saw an outer ring of gigantic
bombards and missile launchers poke their snouts from sunken
emplacements, and the force screen was up, like Satan’s parody of a
halo. But this seemed mere trimming on the strength of the fortress
itself. No aircraft were visible, save our own.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By now I, like most of us, had had some
instruction in the use of the far-speaker. I tuned it until the
image of a Wersgor officer appeared in its screen. He had obviously
been trying to tune in on me, so we had lost several minutes. His
face was pale, almost cerulean, and he gulped several times before
he could ask: “What do you want?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger scowled. Bloodshot, dark-rimmed
eyes, in a face whose flesh seemed melted away by care, gave him a
frightful appearance. I having translated, he snapped: Huruga.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We .. . we shall not surrender our grath.
He told us so himself.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Brother Parvus, tell that idiot I only want
to talk to the duke! A parley. Haven’t they any idea at all of
civilized custom?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgor gave us a hurt look, since I
told him my lord’s exact words, but spoke into a little box and
touched a series of buttons. His image was replaced with that of
Huruga. The governor rubbed sleep from his eyes and said with
forlorn courage, “Don’t expect to destroy this place as you did the
others. Darova was built to be an ultimate strong point. The
heaviest bombardment could only remove the aboveground works. If
you attempt a direct assault, we can fill the air and the land with
blasts and metal.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger nodded. “But how long can you
maintain such a barrage? he asked mildly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga bared his sharp teeth. “Longer than
you can mount the assault, you animal!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nonetheless,” Sir Roger murmured, “I doubt
if you’re equipped for a siege.” I could find no Wersgor term in my
limited vocabulary for that last word, and Huruga seemed to have
trouble understanding the circumlocutions by which I rendered it.
When I explained why it took me so long to translate, Sir Roger
nodded shrewdly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I suspected as much,” he said. “Look you,
Brother Parvus. These starfaring nations have weapons nigh as
powerful as St. Michael’s sword. They can blow up a city with one
shell, and lay waste a shire with ten. But this being so, how could
their battles ever be prolonged? Eh? Yon castle is built to take
hammer blows. But a siege? Hardly!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To the screen: “I shall establish myself
near by, keeping watch on you. At the first sign of life from your
castle, I’ll open fire. So ‘twere best that your men stay
underground all whiles. At any time you wish to surrender, call me
on the far-speaker, and I’ll be pleased to extend the courtesies of
war.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Huruga grinned. I could almost read the
thoughts behind that snout. The English were more than welcome to
squat outside, till the avenging armada came! He blanked the
screen.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We found a good camp site well beyond the
horizon. It lay in a deep, sheltered valley, through which a river
ran clean and cold and full of fish. Meadows were dotted throughout
the forest; game was abundant, and off duty our men were free to
hunt. For a few of those long days, I watched cheer blossom fresh
among our people.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger gave himself no rest. I think he
dared not; for Lady Catherine left her children with their nurse
and walked among bowers with Sir Owain. Not untended-they were
careful of the proprieties-but her husband would glimpse them and
turn to snarl a command at the nearest person.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hidden away in these woods, our camp was
safe enough from shellfire or missiles. Its tents and leantos, our
weapons and tools, were not a large enough concentration of metal
to be sniffed out by one of the Wersgor magnetic devices. Such of
our aircraft as maintained watch on Darova, always landed
elsewhere. We kept trebuchets loaded, in case any activity were
revealed about the fortress; but Huruga was content to wait
passive. Sometimes a daring enemy vessel passed overhead, having
come from some other spot on the planet. But it never found any
target for its explosives, and our own patrol soon forced it
away.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most of our strength-the great ships and
guns and war-wagons-were elsewhere all this time. I myself did not
see the hunting Sir Roger undertook. I stayed in camp, busying
myself with such problems as teaching myself more Wersgor and
Branithar more English. I also started classes in the Wersgor
language for some of our more intelligent boys. Nor would I have
wished to go on the baron’s expedition.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He had spacecraft and aircraft. He had
bombards to fire both flame and shell. He had a few ponderous
turtle-cars, which he hung with shields and pennons and manned with
a cavalryman and four men-at-arms each. He went out across the
continent and harried.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">No isolated estate could withstand his
attack. Looting and burning, he left desolation behind him. He
killed many Wersgorix, but no more than necessary. The rest he
stuffed captive into the huge transport ships. A few times, the
franidins and yeomen tried to make a stand. They had hand weapons
only; his host scattered them like chaff and chivvied them across
their own fields. It took him only a few days and nights to
devastate the entire land mass. Then he made a quick foray across
an ocean, bombed and flamed whatever he chanced upon, and
returned.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To me it seemed a cruel butchery, albeit no
worse than this empire had done on many worlds. However, I own I
have not always understood the logic of such things. Certainly what
Sir Roger did was ordinary European practice in a rebellious
province or a hostile foreign country. Yet when he landed in camp
again, and his men swaggered forth loaded with jewels and rich
fabrics, silver and gold, drunk on stolen liquor and boasting of
what they had done, I went to Branithar.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“These new prisoners are beyond my power,” I
said, “but tell your brothers of Ganturath that before the baron
can destroy them, he must take off my own poor head.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgor gave me a curious look. “What do
you care for our sort?” he asked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“God help me,” I replied. “I do not know,
save that He must also have made you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Word of this reached my lord. He summoned me
to the tent he now used instead of his pavilion. I saw forest
glades choked with captives, milling about like sheep, mumbling and
terrified under the English guns. True, their presence was a shield
to us. Though the ships’ descent must now have revealed our
location closely enough to Huruga’s magnifiers, Sir Roger had taken
care that the governor knew what had happened. But I saw blueskin
mothers holding little wailing blue cubs, and it was like a hand
about my heart.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The baron sat on a stool, gnawing a haunch
of beef. Light and shadow. filtered through leaves, checkered his
face. “What’s this?” he cried. “Are you so fond of yon pigfaces
you’ll not let me have those we caught at Ganturath?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I squared my skinny shoulders. “If’nothing
else, sire,” I told him, “think how such a deed must harm your own
soul.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What?” He raised his thick brows. “When was
it ever forbidden to set free the captive?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My turn came to gape. Sir Roger slapped one
thigh, guffawing. “We’ll keep some few, like Branithar and the
artisans, who’re useful to us. All the rest we’ll herd to Darova.
Thousands and thousands. Don’t you imagine Huruga’s heart will melt
with gratitude?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I stood there in sunlight and tall grass,
while “Haw, haw, haw!” bellowed about me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So under the jeers and spear-prods of our
men, that uncounted throng stumbled through beck and brake, until
they emerged on cleared land and saw the distant mass of Darova. A
few stepped out of the crowd, timorous. The English leaned grinning
on their weapons. One Wersgor began to run. No one fired at him.
Another broke away, and another. Then the entire swarm of them
pelted toward the fortress.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">That evening Huruga yielded.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“’Twas easy enough.’ Sir Roger chuckled. “I
had him bottled up in there. I doubted he had more than just enough
supplies, for siegecraft must be a lost art in this country. So,
first, I showed him I could lay his whole planet waste-which he’d
have to answer for even if we were conquered in the end. Then I
gave him all those extra mouths to feed.” He slapped my back. When
I had been picked up and dusted off, be said, “Well, Brother
Parvus, now that we own this world, would you like to head its
first abbey?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932261" id="_Toc66932261">Chapter XV</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Of course I could not accept any such offer.
Quite apart from difficult questions of consecration, I hope I know
my humble place in life. Anyhow, at this stage it was mere talk. We
had too much else to do, to offer God more than a Mass of
thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We let nearly all the recaptured Wersgorix
go. On a powerful far-speaker, Sir Roger broadcast a proclamation
to Tharixan. He bade every large landholder, in those areas not yet
ravaged, to come make submission and take several of the homeless
ones back with him. The lesson he had taught was so sharp that for
the next few days it swarmed with blue visitors. I must needs deal
with them, and forgot what sleep was like. But for the most part
they were very meek. Indeed, this race had been supreme among the
stars so long that only their soldiers now had occasion to develop
a manly contempt for death. Once these had submitted, the burgesses
and franklins quickly did likewise-and were so used to having an
all-powerful government above them that they never dreamed it might
be possible to revolt.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most of Sir Roger’s attention in that period
went to training his folk in garrison duty. The castle machines
being as simple to operate as most Wersgor equipment, he had soon
had women, children, serfs, and aged manning Darova. They should be
able to hold it against attack for at least a while. Those who
seemed hopelessly incapable in the diabolic arts of meter-reading,
button-pushing, and knob-twisting, he put on a safely distant
island to care for our livestock.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When transplanted Ansby was thus able to
defend itself~ the baron gathered his free companions for yet
another expedition into the sky. He explained his idea to me
beforehand: as yet, I alone had any fluency in the Wersgor tongue,
though Branithar (with Father Simon’s assistance) was instructing
others apace.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We’ve done well so far, Brother Parvus,’
Sir Roger declared. “But alone, we’d never hurl back the Wersgor
hosts being raised against us. I hope by now you’ve mastered their
writing and numerology. At least well enough to keep watch on a
native navigator and see that he doesn’t steer us where we would
not go.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I have studied the principles of their star
maps a little, sire,” I answered, “though in truth they do not
employ charts, but mere columns of figures. Nor do they have mortal
steersmen on the spaceships. Rather, they instruct an artificial
pilot at the start of the journey, and thereafter the homunculus
operates the entire craft.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“How well I know that!” grunted Sir Roger.
“’Twas how Branithar tricked us hither in the first instance. A
dangerous wight, that, but too useful to kill. Glad I am not to
have him aboard on this voyage; and yet I’m not easy in my heart at
leaving him in Darova. . . .”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But where are you bound, sire?” I
interrupted.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh. Aye. That.’ He knuckled eyes sandy with
weariness. “There are other kings than Wersgor. Lesser
star-traveling nations, who dread the day when these snoutface
fiends will decide to make an end of them. I shall seek
allies.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It was an obvious enough move, but I
hesitated. “Well?” demanded Sir Roger. “What ails you now?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“If they have not yet gone to war,” I said
weakly, “why should the advent of a few backward savages like us
make them do so?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Hearken, Brother Parvus,” said Sir Roger.
“I’m weary of this whining about our own ignorance and feebleness.
We’re not ignorant of the true Faith, are we? Somewhat more to the
point, maybe, while the engines of war may change through the
centuries, rivalry and intrigue look no subtler out here than at
home. Just because we use a different sort of weapons, we aren’t
savages.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I could scarcely refute his argument, since
it was our only hope except for a random flight in search of lost
Terra.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The best spaceships were those which had
lain in the vaults of Darova. We were outfitting these, when the
sun was darkened by a still greater vessel. As it hung up there
like a thundercloud, it threw dismay among our folk. But Sir Owain
Montbelle came running with a Wersgor engineer in tow, snatched up
myself to interpret, and led us to the far-speaker. Standing out of
sight of the screen, with sword drawn, Sir Owain made the captive
speak with the master of the ship.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It proved to be a merchant craft, paying a
regular call at this planet. The sight of Ganturath and Stularax
turned into holes horrified its crew. We could easily enough have
blasted the ship down, but Sir Owain used his Wersgor puppet to
tell the captain there had been a raid from space, beaten off by
the Darova garrison, and that he should land here. He obeyed. As
the ship’s outer portals opened, Sir Owain led a swarm of men
aboard and captured it without trouble.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For this, they cheered him night and day.
And he made a brave, colorful figure, always prepared to fling a
jest or a gallantry. Sir Roger, toiling without pause, grew ever
more uncouth. Men stood in awe of him, and some little hatred,
since he drove them to such exertions. Sir Owain contrasted, like
Oberon versus a bear. Half the women must have been in love with
him, though he had songs only for Lady Catherine.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The booty from the giant ship was rich. Best
of all, however, were many tons of grain. We tried some of this on
our livestock on the island, which was growing thin on the detested
blue grass. They accepted the feed as eagerly as if it were English
oats. When he heard this, Sir Roger exclaimed, “Whatever planet
that comes from is the one we must capture next.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I crossed myself and hurried elsewhere.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But we had little time to lose. It was no
secret that Huruga had dispatched spaceships to Wersgorixan
immediately after the second battle of Ganturath. They would take a
while to reach that distant planet, and the emperor would need a
while more to raise a fleet among his widely scattered domains, and
thereafter it would take time for the fleet to get back here. But
already days had fled from us.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To head the Darova garrison of women,
children, aged, and serfs, Sir Roger appointed his wife. I am told
that our chroniclers’ practice of inventing speeches for the great
persons whose lives they write is unscholarly. Yet I knew those
two, not just the haughty exterior but (in glimpses, for it was
shy) the soul. I can all but see them, in a buried room of the
alien castle.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Lady Catherine has hung it with her
tapestries, spread rushes on the floor, and left the walls darkened
in favor of sconced candles, that this place might seem less eerie
to her. She waits in garments of pride, while her husband bids
their children farewell. Little Matilda weeps openly. Robert
withholds the tears, more or less, until he has closed the door on
his father: for he is a de Tourneville.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Slowly, Sir Roger straightens. He has
stopped shaving, for lack of time, and the beard curls like wire on
his scarred hook-nosed face. The gray eyes look burnt out, and a
muscle in his cheek will not stop twitching. Since hot water runs
freely here from pipes, he has bathed; but he wears his usual rough
old jerkin and patched hose. The baldric of his great sword creaks
as he advances toward his wife.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well,” he says awkwardly, “I must
begone.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yes.” Her back is slender and very
straight.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I believe-“ He clears his throat. ‘I
believe you’ve learned everything needful.” When she does not
answer: “Remember, ‘tis most important to keep those students of
the Wersgor tongue hard at their lessons. Otherwise we’ll be
deaf-mutes among our foes. But never trust our prisoners. Two armed
men must always be with each one of them.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Indeed.” She nods. She is uncoifed, and
candlelight slides along the coiled auburn hair. “I shall also
remember that the pigs don’t require that new grain we give the
other animals.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Most important! And be certain to stock
this stronghold well. Those of our folk who have eaten native food
are still in health, so you can requisition from Wersgor
granaries.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Silence thickens about them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well,” he says, “I must begone.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“God be with you, my lord.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He stands a moment, studying each smallest
tone in her voice. “Catherine-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Yes, my lord?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I’ve wronged you,” he forces out. “And I’ve
neglected you, what’s worse.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Her hands reach out, as if of their own
accord. His coarse palms close about them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Any man could be mistaken, now and then,”
she breathes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He dares look into the blue eyes. “Will you
give me a token?” he asks.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“For your safe return-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He drops hands to her waist, draws her close
and cries joyous: “And my final victory! Give me your token, and
I’ll lay this empire at your feet!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She pulls herself free. Horror bestrides her
lips. “When are you going to start looking for our Earth?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What honor is there in slinking home, when
we leave the very stars our enemies?” Pride clashes in his
words.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“God help me,” she whispers, and flees him.
He stands a long while, until the sound of her feet has vanished
down the cold corridors. Then he turns and walks out to his
men.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We could have crowded into one of the big
ships but thought it best to disperse ourselves in a score. These
had been repainted, using Wersgor supplies, by a lad who possessed
some heraldic skill. Now they were scarlet and gold and purple,
with the de Tournevile arms and the English leopards emblazoned on
the flagship.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Tharixan fell behind us. We went into that
strange condition, ducking in and out of more dimensions than
Euclid’s orderly three, which the Wersgorix called “super-light
drive.” Again the stars flamed on every hand, and we amused
ourselves with naming the new constellations-the Knight, the
Plowman, the Arbalest, and more, including some which are not fit
to put in this record.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The voyage was not long: a few Earth-days
only, as near as we could estimate from the clocks. It rested us,
and we were keen as hounds when we coursed into the planetary
system of Bodavant.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By now we understood that there are many
colors and sizes of suns, all intermingled. The Wersgorix, like
humans, favored small yellow ones. Bodavant was redder and cooler.
Only one of its planets was habitable (the usual case); and while
this Both could have been settled by men or Wersgorix, they would
find it dim and chilly. Thus our enemies had not troubled to
conquer the native Jairs but merely prevented them from acquiring
more colonies than they had when discovered, and forced them into
grossly unfavorable trade agreements.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The planet hung like a huge shield, mottled
and rusty, against the stars, when the native warships hailed us.
We brought our flotilla to an obedient halt. Rather, we ceased to
accelerate, and simply plunged through space in a hyperbolic
sub-light orbit which the Jair craft matched. But these problems of
heavenly navigation make my poor head ache; I am content to leave
them to the astrologers and the angels.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger invited the Jair admiral aboard
our flag ship. We used the Wersgor language, of course, with myself
as interpreter. But I shall only render the gist of the
conversation, not the tedious byplay which actually took place.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A reception had been prepared, with an eye
to impressing the visitors. The corridor from the portal to the
refectory was lined with warriors. The longbowmen had patched their
green doublets and hose, made their caps gay with feathers, and
rested their dreadful weapons before them. The common men-atanns
had polished what mail and flat helmets they owned, and formed an
arch of pikes. Beyond, where the passage grew high and broad enough
to allow, twenty cavalrymen gleamed in full armor of plate, banner
and scutcheon, plume and lance, astride our biggest chargers. At
the final door, Sir Roger s huntmaster stood with hawk on wrist and
a pack of mastiffs at his feet. Trumpets blared, drums rolled,
horses reared, dogs gave tongue, and as one we made the ship roar
with the deep-throated cry: “God and St. George for merry England!
Haro!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Jairs looked rather daunted but
continued to the refectory. It was hung with the most gorgeous of
our looted fabrics. At the end of the long table, Sir Roger, in
broidered garments, surrounded by halberdiers and crossbowmen, sat
on a throne hastily knocked together by our carpenters. As the
Jairs entered, he raised a golden Wersgor beaker and drank their
health in English ale. He had wanted to use wine, but Father Simon
had decided to reserve it for Holy Communion, pointing out that
foreign devils wouldn’t know the difference.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Waes hâeil!” declaimed Sir Roger, an
English phrase he loved even when speaking his more usual
French.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Jairs hesitated until page boys showed
them to their places with as much ceremony as the royal court.
Thereafter I said a rosary and asked a blessing upon our
conference. This was not, I confess, done for purely religious
reasons. We had already gathered that the Jairs employed certain
verbal formulas to invoke hidden powers of body and brain. If they
were benighted enough to take my sonorous Latin for a still more
impressive version of the same thing, the sin was not ours, was
it?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Welcome, my lord,” said Sir Roger. He, too,
looked much rested. There was even a sparkle of devilty about him.
Only those who knew him well could have guessed what emptiness
housed within. “I pray pardon for my unceremonious entrance into
your domain, but the news I bear will scarcely wait.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Jair admiral leaned tensely forward. He
was a little taller than a man, though more slender and graceful,
with soft gray fur over his body and a white ruff around his head.
The face was cat-whiskered and had enormous purple eyes, but
otherwise looked human. That is to say, it looked as human as the
faces in a triptych painted by a not very skillful artist. He wore
close-fitting garments of brown stuff, with insignia of rank. But
drab indeed they looked, he and his eight associates, next to the
splendor we had scraped up. His name, we found later, was Beijad
sor Van. Our expectation that the one in charge of interplanetary
defenses would stand high in the government proved well
founded.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We had no idea the Wersgorix would trust
any other folk enough to arm them as allies,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger laughed. “Hardly, gentle sir! I am
come from Tharixan, which I’ve just taken over. We’re using
captured Wersgor ships to eke out our own.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Beijad sat bolt upright. His fur bristled
with excitement. “Are you another star-traveling race, then?” he
cried.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We fight Englishmen,” Sir Roger evaded. He
did not wish to lie to potential allies more than he must, for
their indignation on discovering it might prove troublesome. ‘Our
lords have extensive foreign possessions, such as Ulster, Leinster,
Normandy-but I’ll not weary you with a catalogue of planets.” I
alone noticed he had not actually said those counties and duchies
were planets. “To put it briefly, ours is a very old civilization.
Our records go back for more than five thousand years.” He used the
Wersgor equivalent, as nearly as possible. And who shall deny that
Holy Writ runs with absolute accuracy from the time of Adam?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Beijad was less impressed than we had
expected. “The Wersgorix boast a mere two thousand years of clearly
established history, since their civilization rebuilt itself after
its final internecine war,” he said. “But we Jairs possess a
reliable chronology for the past eight millennia.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“How long have you practiced space flight?”
Sir Roger asked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“For about two centuries.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ah. Our earliest experiments of that sort
were- how long ago, would you say, Brother Parvus?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“About thirty-five hundred years, at a place
called Babel,” I told them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Beljad gulped. Sir Roger continued smoothly,
“This universe is so large that the expanding English kingdom did
not run into the expanding Wersgor domain until very recently. They
didn’t realize our true powers but attacked us unprovoked. You know
their viciousness. We’re a very peaceful race ourselves.” We had
learned from contemptuous prisoners that the Jair Republic deplored
warfare and had never colonized a planet which already had
inhabitants. Sir Roger folded his hands and rolled his eyes upward.
“Indeed,” he said, “one of our most basic commandments is, ‘Thou
shalt not kill.’ Yet it seemed a greater sin, to let so cruel and
dangerous a power as Wersgorixan continue to ravage helpless
folk.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Hmm.” Beljad rubbed his furry brow. “Where
does this England of yours lie?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Now, now,” purred Sir Roger. “You can’t
expect us to tell even the most honored strangers that, until a
better understanding has been reached. The Wersgorix themselves don
t know, for we captured their scoutship. This expedition of mine
has come hither to punish them and gather information. As I told
you, we captured Tharixan with small loss to ourselves. But ‘tis
not our monarch’s way to intervene in affairs that concern other
intelligent species, without consulting their wishes. I swear King
Edward III has never dreamed of doing so. I’d much prefer to have
you Jairs, and others who’ve suffered at Wersgor hands, join me in
a crusade to humble them. And thus you’ll earn the right to divide
up their empire fairly and squarely with us.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Are you-the head of a single military
force- empowered to undertake such negotiations?” Beljad asked
doubtfully.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Sir, I am no petty noble,” the baron
answered with great stiffness. ‘My descent is as lofty as any in
your realm. An ancestor of mine, by the name of Noah, was once
admiral of the combined fleets of my planet.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“This is so sudden,” Beljad faltered.
“Unheard of. We cannot-I cannot-it has to be discussed, and-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Certes.” My lord raised his voice till the
chamber rang. “But don’t dawdle overly long, gentles. I offer you a
chance to help destroy the Wersgor barbarism, whose existence
England can no longer suffer. If you’ll share the burden of war,
you’ll share the fruits of conquest. Otherwise we English will be
forced to occupy the entire Wersgor domain: for someone must keep
order in it. So I say, join the crusade under my leadership, and
haro for victory!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932262" id="_Toc66932262">Chapter XVI</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Jairs, like the other free nations, were
no simpletons. They invited us to land and be guests on their
planet. Strange was that stay, as if we spent it in timeless Elf
Hill. I remember slim towers, bridges looped airily between, cities
where buildings mingled with parks to make one gigantic pleasance,
boats on bright lakes, scholars in robe and veil who would
discourse with me of English learning, enormous alchemical
laboratories, music that still haunts my dreams. But this is no
geographical book. And even the soberest account of ancient
non-human civilizations would sound wilder to a common English ear
than the fantasies of that notorious Venetian, Marco Polo.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While Jair war leaders, wise men, and
politicians sought to probe us for information, however
courteously, an expedition hastened to Tharixan to see for itself
what had happened. Lady Catherine received them with much pomp and
allowed them to interview any Wersgorix they chose. She hid away
only Brani thar, who would have given too much truth. The rest,
even Huruga, had nothing but a confused impression of irresistible
onslaught.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Being unfamiliar with the variations in
human appearance, they did not realize that the Darova garrison was
composed of our weakest. But they counted it and could hardly
believe that so small a force as ours had accomplished all this.
Surely we must have unknown powers in reserve! When they saw our
neatherds, riders on horseback, women cooking over wood fires, they
swallowed easily enough an explanation that we English preferred as
much open-air simplicity of life as possible; it was an ideal of
their own.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Fortunate we were that the language barrier
limited them to what they could observe of us with their eyes.
Those lads learning Wersgor had, as yet, mastered too few words for
inteffigible conversation. Many a commoner-or even warrior, it may
be-would have blurted his own terror and ignorance, begged them to
take him home again, had he been able. As it was, all detailed
speech with the English must be filtered through myself. And I
relayed Sir Roger’s cheerful arrogance.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He did not hide from them that an avenging
Wersgor fleet would soon fall on Darova. Rather, he boasted of it.
His trap was set, he claimed. If Boda and the other starfaring
planets would not help him spring it, he must call England for
reinforcements.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The idea of an armada from a totally unknown
realm, entering their region of space, disquieted the Jair leaders.
I make no doubt that some of them took us for mere adventurers,
outlaws perhaps, who could actually count on no help from our
birthplace. But then others must have argued:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Dare we stand by and take no hand in what
is to happen? Even if they are pirates, these newcomers have
conquered a planet, and show no fear of the whole Wersgor Empire.
In every case, we must arm ourselves against the possibility that
England is- despite their denials-as aggressive as the blueface
nation. So would it not be best to strengthen ourselves by helping
this Roger, occupying many planets and taking much booty? The only
alternative seems to be to make alliance with Wersgor against him,
and that is unthinkable!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Furthermore, the imagination of the Jair
people was captured. They saw Sir Roger and his brilliant
companions gallop down their sedate avenues. They heard of the
defeat he had inflicted on their old enemies. Their folklore, which
had long based itself on the fact that they knew only the smallest
portion of the universe, predisposed them to believe that older and
stronger races existed beyond their maps. Thus, when they heard
that he urged war, they took fire and clamored for it. Boda was a
true republic, not a sham one such as the Wersgor had. This popular
voice rang loud in the parliament.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgor ambassador protested. He
threatened destruction. But he was far from home, the dispatches he
sent would take time to arrive, and meanwhile crowds stoned his
residence.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger himself conferred with two other
emissaries. These were the representatives of the other starfaring
nations, Ashenkoghli and Pr?°tans. The odd letters in the latter
name are my own, standing respectively for a whistle and a grunt. I
will let one such conversation stand for the many that took
place.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As usual, it was in the Wersgor language. I
had more trouble interpreting than I was wont, since the Pr?°tan
was in a box which maintained the heat and poisonous air he needed,
and talked through a loudspeaker with an accent worse than my own.
I never even tried to know his personal name or rank, for these
involved concepts more subtle to the human mind than the books of
Maimonides. I thought of him as Tertiary Eggmaster of the Northwest
Hive, and privately I named him Ethelbert.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We visitors were seated in a cool blue room,
far above the city. While Ethelbert’s tentacled shape, dimly seen
through glass, labored with formal courtesies, Sir Roger glanced
out at the view. “Open windows, broad as a sally port,” he
muttered. ‘What an opportunity! How I’d love to attack this
place!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When our talk was begun, Ethelbert said: “I
cannot commit the Hives to any policy. I can only send a
recommendation. However, since our people have minds less
individualistic than average, I may add that my recommendation will
carry great weight. At the same time, I am correspondingly hard to
convince.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We had already been given to understand
this. As for the Ashenkoghli, they were divided into clans; their
ambassador here was chief of one and could raise its fleet on his
own authority. This so simplified our negotiations that we saw
God’s purpose revealed. I daresay the confidence we gained thereby
was itself a powerful asset to us.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Surely you, good sir, are aware of the
arguments we’ve given the Jairs,” Sir Roger said. “They’re no less
applicable to Pur-Pur-whatever your by-our-lady planet is
called.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I felt an exasperation, that he should throw
on me the whole burden of pronunciation and polite rephrasing, and
set myself a rosary in penance. Wersgor was so barbarous that I
could still not think properly in it. Accordingly, when
interpreting Sir Roger’s French, I first put the gist into my own
boyhood English, then into stately Latin periods, on which firm
foundation I could erect a Wersgor structure that Ethelbert
mentally translated into Pr?°tan. Marvelous are the works of
God.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The Hives have suffered,” admitted the
ambassador. “The Wersgorix limit our space fleet and extraplanetary
possessions; they exact a heavy tribute of rare metals. However,
our home world is useless to them, so we have no fear of ultimate
conquest like Boda and Ashenk. Why, should we ~provoke their
wrath?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I suppose these creatures have no idea of
honor,” the baron grumbled to me, “so tell him he’ll be free of
those restrictions and tribute, once Wersgorixan is
overthrown.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Obviously,” was the cold reply. “Yet the
gain is too small, in comparison with the risk that our planet and
its colonies may be bombarded.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“That risk will be much lessened, if all
Wersgorixan’s foes act together. The enemy’ll be kept too busy to
take offensive action.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But no such alliance exists.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I’ve reason to believe the Ashenkoghli lord
here on Boda plans to join us. Then many other clans of theirs are
sure to do likewise, if only to keep him from gaining too much
power.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Sire,” I protested in English, “you know
that he of Ashenk is less than ready to stake his fleet on this
gamble.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Tell the monster here what I said,
anyhow.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“My lord, it isn’t true!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ah, but we’ll make it come true; so ‘tis no
lie after all.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I choked on the casuistry but rendered it as
required of me. Ethelbert shot back: “What makes you think so? He
of Ashenk is known to be a cautious one.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Certes.” It was a shame that the blandness
of Sir Roger’s tone was wasted on those nonhuman ears. “Therefore
he’s not about to announce his intention openly. But his staff...
some of ‘em blab, or can’t resist dropping a hint-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“This must be investigated!” said Ethelbert.
I could all but read his thoughts. He would set his own spies,
hireling Jairs, to work.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We hied ourselves elsewhere and resumed some
talks Sir Roger had been having with a young Ashenkogh. This fiery
centaur was himself eager for a war in which he might win fame and
wealth. He explained the details of organization, record-keeping,
communication, which Sir Roger needed to know. Then the baron
instructed him what documents to forge and leave for Ethelbert’s
agents to find, what words to let fall in drunkenness, what clumsy
attempts to make at bribing Jair officials.... Erelong everyone but
the Ashenkoghli ambassador himself knew that he was planning to
join us.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So Ethelbert sent a recommendation of war to
Pr?°t. It went secretly, of course, but Sir Roger bribed the Jair
inspector who passed diplomatic messages out in special boxes to
the mailships. The inspector was promised an entire archipelago on
Tharixan. That was a shrewd investment of my lord’s, for it won him
the right to show the Ashenkoghli chief that dispatch ere it
continued on its way. Since Ethelbert had so much confidence in our
cause, the chief sent for his own fleet and wrote letters inviting
the lords of allied clans to do likewise.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By now, the military intelligence of Boda
knew what was going on. They could certainly not allow Pr?°t and
Ashenk to reap so rich a harvest while their planet remained
insignificant. Accordingly, they recommended that the Jairs also
join the alliance. Thus urged, the parliament declared war on
Wersgorixan.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger grinned all over his face. “’Twas
easy to do,” he said when his captains praised him. “I needed but
to inquire the way in which things are done hereabouts, which was
never secret. Then the star-folk tumbled into snares which would
not have fooled a half-witted prince of Germans.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But how could that be, sire?” asked Sir
Owain. “They’re older and stronger and wiser than we.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The first two, granted,” nodded the baron.
His humor was so good that he addressed even this knight with frank
fellowship. “But the third, no. Where it comes to intrigue, I’m no
master of it myself, no Italian. But the starfolk are like
children.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And why? Well, on Earth there’ve been many
nations and lords for many centuries, all at odds with each other,
under a feudal system nigh too complicated to remember. Why’ve we
fought so many wars in France? Because the Duke of Anjou was on the
one hand the sovereign king of England and on the other hand a
Frenchman! Think you what that led to; and yet ‘tis really a minor
example. On our Earth, we’ve perforce learned all the knavery there
is to know.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But up here, for centuries, the Wersgorix
have been the only real power. They conquered by only one method,
crude obliteration of races which had not weapons to fight back. By
sheer force-the accident that they had the largest domain-they
imposed their will on the three other nations which possessed such
military arts. These, being impotent, never even tried to plot
against Wersgorixan. None of this has called for more statecraft or
generalship than a snowball fight. It took no skill for me to play
on simplicity, greed, dawnin~ fear, and mutual rivalry.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘You are too modest, sire.” Sir Owain
smiled.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Argh!” The baron’s pleasure vanished.
“Satan take such matters. The only important thing now is: here we
sit, stewing, until the fleet is raised. And meanwhile the enemy is
on his way!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Indeed, that was a nightmare time. We could
not leave Boda to join our women and children in the fortress, for
the alliance was still unstable. A hundred times Sir Roger must
patch it up, often using means that would cost him dearly in the
next life. The rest of us spent our time studying history,
languages, geography (or should I say astrolo~’?), and the
witchlike mechanic arts. This latter must be done on pretext of
comparing local engines with those of our home, to the detriment of
the former. Luckily, though not unnaturally-Sir Roger had extracted
the information from officers and documents, ere we left Tharixan-
certain of the arms we captured there were secret. Thus we could
demonstrate an especially effective handgun or explosive ball and
claim it was English, taking care that none of our allies got too
close a look at it.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The night the Jair liaison ship returned
from Thanxan, with word that the enemy armada had arrived. Sir
Roger went alone into his bedchamber. I do not know what happened,
but next morning his sword needed sharpening and all the furniture
lay in splinters.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">God granted, though, that we had not much
longer to wait. The Bodavant fleet was already gathered in orbit.
Now several dozen lean battlecraft from Ashenk arrived, and soon
thereafter the boxlike vessels of Pr?°t lumbered in from their
poisonous home world. We embarked and roared off to war.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our first glimpse of Darova, after we had
fought past outlying Wersgor ships and into Tharixan’s atmosphere,
made me doubt that aught was left to rescue. For hundreds of miles
around the land lay black, ripped, and desolated. Rock bubbled
molten wherever a shell had newly struck. That subtle death which
can only be sensed with instruments had lain waste this entire
continent, and would linger for years.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But Darova was built to withstand such
forces, and Lady Catherine had provisioned it well. I glimpsed a
Wersgor flotilla as it screamed low above her forcefield. Their
missiles burst close, causing the near-solid stone of the
aboveground structures to flow on the outside-but leaving the
interiors unharmed. The seared earth opened; bombards thrust out
like viper tongues, spat lightning, and retracted ere fresh
explosives could smite. Three Wersgor ships tumbled in ruin. Their
wrecks were added to the carnage which was left from an attempt to
storm this place on the ground.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Then I saw no more smoke-veiled Darova. For
the Wersgorix were upon us in force, and the combat moved up again
into space.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Strange was that battle. It was fought at
unimaginable distances with fire-beams, cannon shells, unmanned
missiles. Ships maneuvered under direction from artificial brains,
so fast that only the weight-making fields prevented their crews
from being smeared across the bulkheads. Hulls were blown open by
near-misses, yet could not sink in airless space: the wounded
portions sealed themselves off, and the remainder continued to
shoot.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Such was the usual way of space war. Sir
Roger made an innovation. It had horrified the Jair admirals when
he first proposed it, but he had insisted it was a standard English
tactic-which it was, in a way. Actually, of course, he did it for
fear that his men would otherwise betray their clumsiness with the
hellweapons.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So he disposed them in numerous small,
exceedingly fast craft. Our over-all plan of battle was made highly
unorthodox, for no other reason than to maneuver the enemy into
certain positions. When that chance came, Sir Roger’s boats flitted
into the heart of the Wersgor fleet. He lost some few, but the
others continued their outrageous orbit, to the very flagship of
the foe. It was a monstrous thing, almost a mile long, even big
enough to carry force-field generators. But the English used
explosives to punch through its hull. Then, in space armor, atop
which the knights planted their crests-carrying sword, ax, halberd,
and bow, as well as handguns-they boarded.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">They were not enough to seize that entire
labyrinth of corridors and cabins. Yet they enjoyed themselves,
suffered small loss (sailors out here being untrained in
hand-to-hand fighting), and threw matters into a confusion which
vastly aided our general assault. Eventually the crew abandoned
that ship. Sir Roger saw them doing so and withdrew his own troop
just before the hull was blown to bits.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Only God and the more warlike saints know if
his action proved decisive. The allied fleet was outnumbered and
very much out-gunned, so every gain we made was valuable out of
proportion. On the other hand, our attack had come as a surprise.
And we had boxed the foe between ourselves and Darova, whose
largest missiles flew into space itself to destroy Wersgor
craft.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I cannot describe the vision of St. George,
for it was not my privilege to observe this. However, many a sober,
trustworthy man-at-arms swore that he saw the holy knight ride down
the Milky Way in a foam of stars and impale enemy ships on his
lance like so many dragons. Be this as it may, after many hours
which I remember but dimly, the Wersgonix gave up. They withdrew in
good order, having lost perhaps a fourth of their fleet, and we did
not pursue them far.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Instead, we hovered above blackened Darova.
Sir Roger and the chiefs of his allies went down in a boat. In the
central underground hail, the English garrison, grimy and exhausted
from days of battle, gave a feeble cheer. Lady Catherine took time
to bathe and garb herself in her best, for honor’s sake. She swept
out like a queen to greet the captains.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But when she saw her husband, standing in
dinted space armor against the chilly glow-light, her stride
faltered. “My lord-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He took off his glazed helmet. The air tubes
got somewhat in the way of his knightly gesture, as he tucked it
under an arm and went to one knee before her. “No,” he cried aloud.
“Say not that. Let me rather say, ‘My lady and love.’”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She advanced like a sleepwalker. “Is the
victory yours?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No. Yours.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And now-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He rose, grimacing as the necessities~
clamped back down on him. “Conferences.” he said. “Repair of battle
damage. Making of new ships, raising of more armies. Intrigues
among allies, heads to knock together, laggards to hearten. And
fighting to do, always fighting. Until, God willing, the bluefaces
are whipped back to their home planet and submit-“ He stopped. Her
face had lost its quick lovely color. “But for tonight, my lady,”
he said, unskillfully, though he must have rehearsed it many times,
“I think we ye earned the right to be alone, that I may praise
you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She drew a shaken breath. “Did Sir Owain
Montbelle live?” she asked. When he did not say no, she crossed
herself, and a tiny smile flickered on her lips. Then she bade the
alien captains welcome and held out her hand for them to kiss.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932263" id="_Toc66932263">Chapter XVII</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I come now to a grievous part of this
history, and the most difficult to write. Nor was I present, save
at the very end.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This was because Sir Roger hurled himself
into his crusade as if he fled from something-which in a way was
true-and I was dragged with him like a leaf whirled along in a
gale. I was his interpreter, but at every moment when we had naught
else to do I became his teacher and would instruct him in Wersgor
until my poor weak flesh could endure no more. My last glimpse, ere
I toppled into sleep, would be of candlelight guttering on my
lord’s haggard face. Then he would often as not summon a doctor of
the Jair language, who would teach him until dawn. At this rate, it
was not many weeks before he could curse hideously in both
tongues.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Meanwhile, he drove his allies nigh as hard
as he did himself. The Wersgorix must be given no chance to
recover. Planet after planet must be attacked, reduced, and
garrisoned, so that the foe always fought off balance, on the
defensive. In this task, we had much help from enslaved native
populations. As a rule, these need only be given arms and
leadership. Then they attacked their masters in such hordes, with
such ferocity, that the latter fled to us for protection. Jairs,
Ashenkoghli, and Pr?*tans were horrified. They had no experience in
such matters; whereas Sir Roger had encountered the Jacquene in
France. In their bewilderment, his fellow chieftains came more and
more to accept his unquestioned leadership.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The ins and outs of what happened are too
complex, too various from world to world, for this paltry record.
But in essence, on each inhabited planet, the Wersgorix had
destroyed whatever original civilization existed. Now the Wersgor
system in turn was toppled. Into this vacuum-unreligion, anarchy,
banditry, famine, the ever-present menace of a blueface return, the
necessity of training the natives themselves to eke out our thin
garrisons-Sir Roger stepped. He had a solution to these problems,
one hammered out in Europe during those not dissimilar centuries
after Rome fell: the feudal system.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But just when he was thus laying the
cornerstone of victory, it crumbled for him. God rest his soul! No
more gallant knight ever lived. Even now, a lifetime later, tears
dim my old eyes, and I were fain to hurry over this part of the
chronicle. Since I witnessed so little, it would be excusable for
me to do so.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, those who betrayed their lord did
not rush into it. They stumbled. Had Sir Roger not been blind to
all warning signs, it would never have happened. Therefore I shall
not set it down in cold words, but fall back on the earlier (and, I
think, truer) practice of inventing whole scenes, that folk now
dust may live again and be known, not as abstract villainies, but
as fallible souls: on whom perhaps God, at the very last, had
mercy.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We begin on Tharixan. The fleet had just
departed to seize the first Wersgor colony of its long campaign. A
Jair garrison occupied Darova. But those English women, children,
and grandsires who had so valiantly held fast, were given what
reward lay in Sir Roger s power. He moved them to that island where
our kine were pastured. There they could dwell in woods and fields,
erecting houses, herding, hunting, sowing and reaping, almost as if
it were home. Lady Catherine was set to rule over them. She kept
Branithar, of the Wersgor captives, as much to prevent his
revealing too much to the Jairs as to continue giving instruction
in his language. She also had a small fast spaceship for emergency
use. Visits from the Jairs across the sea were discouraged, lest
they observe too closely.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It was a peaceful time, save in my lady’s
heart.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For her the great grief began the day after
Sir Roger embarked. She walked across a flowery meadow, hearing
wind sough in the trees. A pair of her maids followed behind.
Through the woods came voices, the ring of an ax, the bark of a
dog, but to her they seemed of dreamlike remoteness.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Suddenly she halted. For a moment she could
only stare. Then one hand stole to the crucifix on her breast.
“Mary, have pity.” Her maids, well-trained, slipped back out of
earshot.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain Montbelle hobbled from the glade.
He was in his gayest garb, nothing but a sword to remind her of
war. The crutch on which he leaned hardly interfered with his
gracefulness as he swept off his plumed bonnet in a bow.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ah,” he cried, “this instant the place has
become Arcady, and old Hob the swineherd whom I just met is heathen
Apollo, harping a hymn to the great witch Venus.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What’s this?” Catherine’s eyes were blue
dismay. “Has the fleet returned?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nay.” Sir Owain shrugged. “Blame my own
awkwardness yestre’en. I was frolicking about, playing ball, when I
stumbled. My ankle twisted, and remains so weak and tender that I’d
be useless in battle. Perforce I deputed my command to young Hugh
Thorne and flitted hither in an aircraft. Now I must wait till I am
healed, then borrow a ship and a Jair pilot to rejoin my
comrades.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine tried desperately to speak sober
words. “In . .. in his language lessons ... Branithar has mentioned
that the star folk have s-s-strange chirurgic arts.” She flushed
like fire. “Their lenses can look even inside a living body ... and
they inject simples which heal the worst wound in days.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I thought of that,” said Sir Owain. “For of
course I would not be a laggard in war. But then I remembered my
lord’s strict orders, that our entire hope depends for the nonce on
convincing these demon races we are as learned as they.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She clasped the crucifix still tighter.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“So I dared not ask help of their
physicians,” he continued. “I told them instead that I remain
behind to attend certain matters of moment, and carry this crutch
as a penance for sin. When nature has healed me, I will depart.
Though in truth, ‘twill be like tearing out my own heart, to be
from you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Does Sir Roger know?’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He nodded. They passed hastily to something
else. That nod was a black lie. Sir Roger did not know. None of his
men dared tell him. I might have ventured it, for he would not
strike a man of the cloth, but I was also ignorant. Since the baron
avoided Sir Owain’s company these days, and had enough else to
occupy his mind, he never thought of it. I suppose in his inmost
soul he did not want to think of it.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Whether Sir Owain really hurt his ankle, I
dare not say. But it would be a strange coincidence. However, I
doubt if he had planned his final treason in detail. Most likely
his wish was to continue certain talks with Branithar and see what
developed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He leaned close to Catherine. His laughter
rang out. “Until I go,” he said, “I feel free to bless the
accident.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She looked away, and trembled. “Why?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I think you know.” He took her hand.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She withdrew it. “I beg you, remember my
husband is at war.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Misdoubt me not!” he exclaimed. “I would
sooner lie dead than be dishonored in your eyes.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I could never ... misdoubt ... so courteous
a knight.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Is that all I am? Courteous only? Amusing?
A jester for your weary moments? Well-a-day, better Catherine’s
fool than Venus’ lover. So let me then entertain you.” And he
lifted his clear voice in a roundel to her praise.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No-“ She moved from him, like a doe edging
clear of the hunter. “I am ... I gave pledges-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“In the courts of Love,” he said, “there is
only one pledge, Love itself.” The sunlight burnished his hair.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I have two children to think of,” she
begged.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He grew somber. “Indeed, my lady. I’ve often
dandied Robert and little Matilda on my knee. I hope I may do it
again, while God allows.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She faced him afresh, almost crouching.
“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh-Nay.” He looked into the murmurous
woods, whose leaves were of no shape or color ever seen on Earth.
“I would not voice disloyalty.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But the children!” This time it was she who
seized his hand. “In Christ’s holy name, Owain, if you know aught,
speak!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He kept his face turned from her. He had a
fine profile. “I am not privy to any secrets, Catherine,” he said.
“Belike you can judge the question better than I. For you know the
baron best.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Does anyone know him?” she asked in
bitterness. He said, very low, “It seems to me that his dreams grow
with each new turn of fate. At first he was content to fly to
France and join the King. Then he would liberate the Holy Land.
Brought here by evil fortune, he responded nobly: none can deny
that. But having gained a respite. has he sought Terra again? No,
he took this whole world. Now he is off to conquer suns. Where will
it end?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Where-“ She could not continue. Nor could
she pull her gaze from Sir Owain.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The knight said, “God puts bounds to all
things. Unlimited ambition is the egg of Satan, from which only woe
can hatch. Does it not seem to you, my lady, when you lie sleepless
at night, that we will overreach ourselves and be ruined?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">After a long while he added: “Wherefore I
say, Christ and His Mother help all the little children.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What can we do?” she cried in her anguish.
“We’ve lost our way to Earth!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It might be found again,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“In a hundred years of search?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He watched her in silence for a while before
he answered:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I would not raise false hopes in so sweet a
bosom. But from time to time I’ve conversed a little with
Branithar. Our knowledge of each other’s tongues is but scant, and
certes he does not trust any human overmuch. Yet ... a few things
he has said... make me think that perhaps the road home might be
found.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What?” Both her frantic hands seized him.
“How? Where? Owain, are you gone mad?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No.” he said with studied roughness. “But
let us suppose this be true, than Branithar can guide us despite
all. He’ll not do so without a price, I suppose. Do you think Sir
Roger would renounce his crusade and go quietly back to
England?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“He-why-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Has he not said again and yet again: while
the Wersgor power remains, England lies m mortal danger? Would not
the rediscovery of Terra only lead him to redouble his efforts?
Nay, what use is it to learn our way back? The war would still
continue, until it ended in our destruction.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She shuddered and crossed herself</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Since I am here,” Sir Owain finished, “I
may as well try to learn if the homeward route can indeed be found.
Perhaps you can think of some means to use that knowledge, ere it
is too late.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He bade her a courtly good day, which she
did not hear, and limped on into the forest.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932264" id="_Toc66932264">Chapter XVIII</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Many long Tharixanian days passed: weeks of
Earth time. Having taken the first planet he aimed at, Sir Roger
went on to the next. Here, while his allies distracted the enemy
gunners, he stormed the main castle afoot, using foliage to conceal
his approach. This was the place where Red John Hameward actually
did rescue a captive princess. True, she had green hair and
feathery antennae, nor was there any possibility of issue between
her species and our own. But the humanlikeness, and exceeding
gratitude, of the Vashtunari-who had just been in process of being
conquered-did much to cheer lonely Englishmen. Whether or not the
prohibitions of Leviticus are applicable is still being hotly
debated.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Wersgorix counterattacked from space,
basing their fleet in a ring of planetoids. Sir Roger had taken an
opportunity while en route to turn off the artificial weight aboard
ship and let his men practice movement under such conditions. So
now, armored against vacuum, our bowmen made that famous raid
called the Battle of the Meteors. Cloth-yard shafts pierced many a
Wersgor spacesuit without fire-flash or magnetic force-pulse to
give away a man’s position. With their base thus depleted of
manpower, the enemy withdrew from the entire system. Admiral Beljad
had grabbed off three other suns while they were occupied with this
one, so their new retreat was a long one.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And on Tharixan, Sir Owain Montbelle made
himself pleasant to Lady Catherine. And he and Branithar felt each
other out, cautiously, under pretext of language study. At last
they thought they had touched mutual understanding.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It remained to convince the baroness.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I believe both moons had risen. Treetops
were hoar with that radiance; double shadows reached across grass
where dew glittered; by now, the night sounds had become familiar
and peaceful. Lady Catherine left her pavilion, as often after her
children were fallen asleep and she unable to. Wrapped in a hooded
mantle, she walked down a lane intended for the street of the new
village, past half-finished wattle huts that were blocks of shadow
under the moons, and out onto a meadow through which ran a brook.
The water flowed and sparkled with light; it chimed on rocks. She
drank a warm strange smell of flowers, and remembered English
hawthorn when they crowned the May Queen. She remembered standing
on the pebble beach at Dover, newly wed, when her husband had
embarked on a summer’s campaign, and waving and waving until the
last sail was vanished. Now the stars were a colder shore, and no
one would see her kerchief if it fluttered. She bent her head and
told herself she would not weep.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Harp strings jingled in the dark. Sir Owain
trod forth. He had discarded his crutch, though he still affected a
limp. A massy silver chain caught moonlight across his black velvet
tunic, and she saw him smile.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oho,” he said softly, “the nymphs and
dryads are out!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nay.” Despite all resolutions, she felt’
gladdened. His banter and flattery had lightened so many sad hours;
they brought back her courtly girlhood. She fluttered protesting
hands, knew she was being coy, but could not stop. “Nay, good
knight, this is unseemly.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Beneath such a sky, and in such a presence,
nothing is unseemly,” he told her. “For we are assured there is no
sin in Paradise.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Speak not so!” Her pain came back
redoubled. “If we have wandered anywhere, ‘tis into hell.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Wherever my lady is, there is
Paradise.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Is this any place to hold a Court of Love?”
she gibed bitterly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“No.” He grew solemn in his turn. “Indeed, a
tent-or a log cabin, when they complete it-is no place for her to
dwell who commands all hearts. Nor are these marches a fit home for
you... or your children. You should sit among roses as Queen of
Love and Beauty, with a thousand knights breaking lances in your
honor and a thousand minstrels singing your charms.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She tried to protest, “’Twould be enough to
see England again-‘ but her voice would go no further.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He stood gazing into the brook where twin
moonpaths glided and shivered. At last he reached beneath his
cloak. She saw steel gleam in his hand. An instant she shrank away.
But he raised the crosshilt upward and said, in those rich tones he
well knew how to use: “By this token of my Saviour and my honor, I
swear you shall have your wish!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His blade sank. He stared at it. She could
scarcely hear him when he added, “If you truly wish it.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What do you mean?” She drew her mantle
tight, as if the air were cold. Sir Owain’s gaiety was not the
hoarse boisterousness of Sir Roger, and his present gravity was
more eloquent than her husband’s stammering protestations. Yet
briefly she felt afraid of Sir Owain, and would have given all her
jewels to see the baron clank from the forest.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You never say plainly what you mean,” she
whispered.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He turned a face of disarming boyish
ruefulness on her. “Mayhap I never learned the difficult art of
blunt speech. But if now I hesitate, ‘tis because I am loath to
tell my lady that which is hard.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She straightened. For a moment, in the
unreal light, she looked strangely like Sir Roger; it was his
gesture. Then she was only Catherine, who said with forlorn
courage, “Tell me anyhow.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Branithar can find Terra again,” he
said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She was not one to faint. But the stars
wavered. She regained awareness leaning against Sir Owain’s breast.
His arms enclosed her waist, and his lips moved along her cheek
toward her mouth. She drew a little away, and he did not pursue his
kiss. But she felt too weak to leave his embrace.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I call this hard news,” he said, “for
reasons I’ve discussed erenow. Sir Roger will not give up his
war.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But he could send us home!” she gasped.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain looked bleak. “Think you he will?
He needs every human soul to maintain his garrisons and keep up an
appearance of strength. You recall what he proclaimed ere the fleet
left Tharixan. As soon as a planet seems strongly enough held, he
will send off people of this village to join those few men he has
newly created dukes and knights. As for himself-oh, aye, he talks
of ending England’s peril, but has he never spoken of making you a
queen?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She could only sigh, remembering a few words
let slip.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Branithar himself shall explain.” Sir Owain
whistled. The Wersgor stepped from a canebrake where he had waited.
He could move about freely enough, since he had no hope of escaping
the island. His stocky form was well clad in plundered raiment,
which glittered as with a thousand tiny pearls. The round,
hairless, longeared, snouted face no longer seemed ugly; the yellow
eyes were even gay. By now Catherine could follow his language well
enough for him to address her.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“My lady will wonder how I could ever find
my way back along a zigzag route taken through swarming uncharted
stars,” he said. “When the navigator’s notes were lost at
Ganturath, I myself despaired. So many suns, even of the type of
your own, lie within the radius of our cruise, that random search
might rec1uire a thousand years. This is the more true since
nebulosities in space hide numbers of stars until one chances
fairly close to them. To be sure, if any deck officers of my ship
had survived, they could have narrowed down the search somewhat.
But my own work was with the engines. I saw stars only in casual
glimpses, and they meant nothing to me. When I tricked your
people-rue the day!-all I did was push an emergency control which
instructed an automaton to pilot us hither.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A lift of excitement brought back impatience
to Catherine. She pulled free of Sir Owain’s arms and snapped, “I’m
not altogether a fool. My lord respected me enough to try to
explain these things to me, however ill I listened. What news have
you discovered?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Not discovered,” said Branithar.
“Remembered. ‘Tis an idea which should have occurred to me erenow,
but there was so much happening- Well</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Know, then, my lady, that there are certain
beacon stars, brilliant enough to be visible throughout the spiral
arm of the Via Galactica. They are used in navigation. Thus, if the
suns called (by us) Ulovarna, Yariz, and Gratch, are seen to form a
certain configuration with respect to each other, one must be in a
certain region of space. Even a crude visual estimate of the angles
would fix one’s position within twenty or so light-years. This is
not too large a sphere to find a given yellow-dwarf sun like your
own.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She nodded, slowly and thoughtfully. “Aye.
Belike you think of bright stars like Sirius and Rigel. . .</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The major stars in the sky of a planet may
not be the ones I mean,” he warned. “They may simply happen to lie
close by. Actually, a navigator would need a good sketch of your
constellations, with numerous bright stars indicated by color (as
seen from airless space). Given enough data, he could analyze and
determine which must be the beacon giants. Then their relative
positions would tell him where they had been observed from.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I think I could draw the Zodiac for you,”
said Lady Catherine uncertainly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It would be of no use, mistress,” Branithar
told her. “You have no skill in identifying stellar types by eye. I
admit I have little enough: no training at all, merely the casual
hearsay about other people’s special crafts which one picks up. And
while I did chance to be in the control turret once, while our ship
was orbiting about Terra making long-range observations, I paid no
special heed to the constellations. I have no memory of what they
looked like.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Her heart tumbled downward. “But then we’re
still lost!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Not quite so. I should say, I have no
conscious memory. Yet we Wersgorix have long known that the mind is
composed of more than the self-aware portion.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“True,” agreed Catherine wisely. “There is
the soul.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Er . . . that’s not exactly what I meant.
There is an unconscious or half-conscious depth in the mind, the
source of dreams and- Well, anyhow, let it suffice that this
unawareness never forgets. It records even the most trivial things
which ever impinged on the senses. If I were thrown into a trance
and given proper guidance, I could draw quite an accurate picture
of the Terrestrial sky, as glimpsed by myself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Then a skilled navigator, his star tables
at hand, could winnow this crop with his arts mathematic. It would
require time. Many blue stars might be Gratch, for example, and
only detailed study could eliminate those which are in an
impossible relationship to (shall we say) the globular cluster
assumed to be Torgelta. Eventually, however, he would narrow the
possibilities down to that smallish region whereof I spoke. Then he
could flit thither, with a space pilot to aid him, and they could
visit all yellow-dwarf stars in the neighborhood until they found
So!.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine smote her hands together. “But
this is wonderful!” she cried. “Oh, Branithar, what reward do you
wish? My lord will bestow a kingdom on you!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He planted his thick legs wide, looked up
into her shadowed face and said with the surly valor we had come to
know:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What joy would a kingdom give me, built
from the shards of my people’s empire? Why should I help find your
England again, if it only brings more Englishmen ravening
hither?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She clenched her fists and said with Norman
bleakness, “You’ll not withhold your knowledge from OneEyed
Hubert.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He shrugged. “The unaware mind is not
readily evoked, my lady. Your barbarous tortures might set up an
impassable barrier.” He reached beneath his tunic. Suddenly a knife
gleamed in his hand. “Not that I would endure them. Stand back!
Owain gave me this. I know well enough where my own heart
lies.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine whirled about with a tiny
shriek.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The knight laid both hands on her shoulders.
“Hear me before you judge,” he said swiftly. “For weeks I’ve been
trying to sound out Branithar. He dropped hints. I dropped hints in
turn. We bargained like two Saracen merchants, never openly
admitting that we bargained. At last he named that dagger as the
price of spreading out his wares for me to see. I could not imagine
him harming any of us with it. Even our children now go about with
better weapons than a knife. I took it on myself to agree. Then he
told me what he has now told you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The tautness shuddered out of her. She had
taken too many shocks in all this time, with too much fear and
solitude in between. Her strength was drained.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What do you require?” she asked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar ran a thumb along his knife blade,
nodded, and sheathed it again. He spoke quite gently. “First, you
must obtain a good Wersgor mind-physician. I can find one with the
help of this planet’s Domesday Book, which is kept at Darova. You
can borrow it from the Jairs on some pretext. This physician has to
work together with a skilled Wersgor navigator, who can tell him
what questions to ask of me and guide my pencil as I draw the map
in my trance. Later we will also need a space pilot; and I insist
on a pair of gunners as well. These can also be found somewhere on
Tharixan. You can tell your allies you want them to help search out
technical secrets of the enemy.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“When you have your star map, what?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, I shall not turn it freely over to
your husband! I suggest that we go secretly aboard your spaceship.
There will be a fair balance of power: you humans holding the
weapons, we Wersgorix the knowledge. We will stand ready to destroy
those notes, and ourselves, if you betray us. At long range, we can
haggle with Sir Roger. Your own pleas ought to sway him. If he
withdraws from the war, transportation home can be arranged, and
our nation will undertake to leave yours alone hereafter.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“If he won’t agree?” Her voice remained
dull.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain leaned close, to whisper in
French: “Then you and the children ... and myself... will
nonetheless be returned. But Sir Roger must not be told this, of
course.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I cannot think.” She covered her face.
“Father in Heaven, I know not what to do!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“If your folk persist in this lunatic war,”
Branithar said, ‘it can only end in their destruction.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain had told her the same thing, over
and over, all this time when he was the only one of her station on
this planet, the only one to whom she could freely talk. She
remembered scorched corpses in the fortress ruins; she thought how
small Matilda had screamed during the siege of Darova, each time a
shellburst rocked the walls; she thought of green English woods
where she had gone hawking with her lord in the first years of
their marriage, and of the years he now expected to spend fighting
for a goal she could not understand. She lifted her face to the
moons, light ran cold along her tears, and she said, “Yes.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932265" id="_Toc66932265">Chapter XIX</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I cannot tell what drove Sir Owain to his
treachery. Two souls had ever striven in his breast; his deepest
heart must always have remembered how his mother’s people had
suffered at the hands of his father’s. In part, no doubt, his
feelings were truly what he claimed to Catherine: horror at the
situation, doubt of our victory, love for her person, and concern
for her safety. And in part there was a less honorable motive,
which may have begun as an idle thought but waxed with time-what
might not be done on Terra with a few Wersgor weapons! Reader of my
chronicle, when you pray for the souls of Sir Roger and Lady
Catherine, say a little word for unhappy Sir Owain Montbelle.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Whatever took place in his secret self, the
recreant acted with outward boldness and intelligence. He kept
close watch upon the Wersgorix gotten to assist Branithar. During
the weeks of their toil, while that which Branithar had forgotten
was extracted from his dreams and studied with mathematic devices
of more than Arabian cunning, the knight quietly prepared the
spaceship to go. And always he must keep up the heart of his fellow
conspirator, the baroness.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She wavered in her resolve, wept, stormed,
yelled at him to depart her presence. Once a vessel arrived with
orders for so-and-so many people to come settle on yet another
captured planet. Aboard it was a letter which Sir Roger had sent
his wife. He dictated this to me, for his spelling was not always
under control, and I took it on myself to polish his phrases a
little, so that through their stiffness might come some hint of a
humble and enduring love. Catherine at once wrote a reply,
admitting her actions and imploring forgiveness. But Sir Owain
anticipated this, got the letter ere the ship departed again,
burned it, and persuaded her to abide by their scheme. It was, he
swore, the best for all concerned, even for her lord.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Finally she gave her dwindled village some
excuse about joining her husband. She embarked with the children
and two maid-servants. Sir Owain had learned enough space arts to
send the ship to some known, clear destination-a mere matter of
pressing the correct buttons-so he could also join them openly. The
night before, he had smuggled the Wersgorix aboard: Branithar, the
physician, the pilot, the navigator, and a couple of soldiers
trained to use those bombards projecting out of the hull.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Those were useless within the ship, where
Owain and Catherine bore the only guns. Extra hand weapons were
stowed in the clothes chest in her bedchamber, and one maid was
always stationed there. The girls were so terrified of the
bluefaces that had any attempted to come take a gun, the screaming
would have brought Sir Owain in haste.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Nonetheless, knight and lady must watch
their associates like wolves. For the obvious thing for Branithar
to do was steer to Wersgorixan itself, where he could inform the
emperor of Terra’s location. With all England a hostage, Sir Roger
must submit. Even the knowledge that we were not from a great
space-traveling civilization, but simple minded innocent Christian
folk, mere lambs led to this slaughter, would have so heartened the
Wersgorix and demoralized our allies, that Branithar must on no
account be allowed to communicate the secret.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Not until Sir Owain’s plans had reached
fruition. Perhaps never. I am sure Branithar himself foresaw a
certain awkwardness at the moment when he had deposited his human
comrade on English soil. No doubt he made his own devious plans
against it. But for the present, their interests ran in the same
channel.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These considerations alone will disprove
certain sniggering canards about Lady Catherine. She and Sir Owain
dared never be at ease simultaneously. They must stand watch on
watch, gun at hip, the entire voyage, lest their crew overwhelm
them. It was the most effective chaperonage in history. Not that
she would have misbehaved in any event. Confused and frightened she
might become, but she was never faithless.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain felt reasonably confident that
Branithar’s data were honest. But he insisted on proof. The boat
flew for some ten days, to the indicated region of space. Another
couple of weeks were spent casting about, examining various hopeful
stars. I shall not try to chronicle what the humans felt, as
constellations gradually became familiar again; nor that single
aerial glimpse which their bargain with distrustful Branithar
vouchsafed them, when Dover castle fluttered its pennons above
white cliffs. I do not believe they ever spoke about it.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Their ship screamed from atmosphere and
lined out again for the hostile stars.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc66932266" id="_Toc66932266">Chapter XX</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger had established himself on the
planet we named New Avalon. Our folk needed a rest, and he needed
time to settle many questions of securing that vast kingdom which
had already fallen to him. He was furthermore in secret negotiation
with the Wersgor governor of an entire star cluster. This person
seemed willing to yield up all he controlled, could we give him
suitable bribes and guarantees. The haggling went slowly, but Sir
Roger felt confident of its outcome.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“They know so little about the detection and
use of traitors out here,” he remarked to me, “that I can buy this
fellow for less than an Italian city. Our allies never attempted
this, for they imagined that the Wersgor nation must be as solid as
their own. Yet isn’t it logic, that so great a sprawl of estates,
separated by days and weeks of travel, must in many ways resemble a
European country? Though even more corruptible-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Since they lack the true Faith,” I
said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Hm, well, yes, no doubt. Though I’ve never
found Christians who refused a bribe on religious grounds. I was
thinking that the Wersgor type of government commands no
fealty.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At any rate, we had a little while of peace,
camped in a dale beneath dizzyingly tall cliffs. A waterfall rushed
arrow-straight into a lake more clear than glass, ringed with
trees. Even our sprawling, brawling English camp could not hurt so
much beauty.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I had settled down outside my own little
tent, at ease in a rustic chair. My hard studies laid aside for a
moment, I indulged myself with a book from home, a relaxing
chronicle of the miracles of St. Cosmas. As if from far off, I
heard the crackle of fire-gun practice, the zap of archery, the
cheerful clatter of quarterstaff play. I was almost asleep, when
feet thudded to a halt beside me.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Startled, I blinked upward at the terrified
face of a baronial esquire. “Brother Parvus!” he said. “In God’s
name, come at once!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ugh, uh, whoof?” I said in my
drowsiness.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Exactly,” he groaned.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I gathered my cassock and trotted at his
heels. Sunlight and blossoming bowers and birdsong overhead were
suddenly remote. I knew only the leap of my heart and the
realization of how few and weak and far from home we were. “What’s
awry?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I know not,” said the esquire. “A message
came on the far-speaker, relayed from space by one of our patrol
ships. Sir Owain Montbelle desired private talk with my lord. I
know not what was spoken on the narrow beam. But Sir Roger came
staggering out like a blind man and roared for you. Oh, Brother
Parvus, it was horrible to see!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I thought that I should pray for us all,
doomed if the baron’s strength and cunning could no longer uphold
us. But I was at once too full of pity for him alone. He had borne
too much, too long, with never a soul to share the burden. All
brave saints, I thought, stand by him now.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Red John Hameward mounted guard outside the
portable Jair shelter. He had spied his master’s strickenness, and
dashed thither from the target range. With strung bow, he bellowed
at the crowd that miffed and muttered: “Get you back! Back to your
places! Cod’s death, I’ll put this arrow through the first by
your-lady sod to pester my lord, and break the by-our lady neck o’
the next! Go, I say!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I brushed the giant aside and entered. It
was hot within the shelter. Sunlight filtered through its
translucency had a thick color. Mostly it was furnished with homely
things. leather, tapestry, armor. But one shelf held instruments of
alien manufacture, and a large farspeaker set was placed on the
floor.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger slumped in a chair before this,
chin on breast, his big hands hanging limp. I stole up behind him
and laid my own hand on his shoulder. “What is the matter, sire?” I
asked, as softly as might be.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He hardly moved. “Go away,” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You called for me.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I knew not what I was doing. This is
between myself and- Go away.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His voice was flat, but it took my whole
small stock of courage to walk around in front of him and say, “I
presume your receiver inscribed the message as usual?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Aye. No doubt. I’d best wipe out that
record.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His gray gaze lifted toward me. I remembered
a wolf I had once seen trapped, when the townsfolk closed in to
make an end of it. “I don’t want to harm you, Brother Parvus,” he
said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Then don’t,” I answered brusquely, and
stooped to turn on the playback.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He gathered his powers, in great weariness.
“If you see that message,” he warned, “I must kill you for my
honor.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I thought back to my boyhood. There had been
various short, pungent, purely English words in common use. I
selected one and pronounced it. From the corner of an eye, as I
squatted by the dials, I saw his jaw fall. He sank back into his
chair. I pronounced another English word for good measure.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Your honor lies in the well-being of your
people,” I added. “You’re not fit to judge anything which can so
shake you as this. Sit down and let me hear it.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He huddled into himself. I turned a switch.
Sir Owarn’s face leaped into the screen. I saw that be was also
gaunt, the handsomeness less evident, the eyes thy and burning. He
spoke in formal, courteous wise, but could not hide his
exultation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I cannot remember his exact words. Nor do
they matter. He told his lord what had happened. He was now in
space, with the stolen ship. He had approached close to New Avalon
to beam this call but taken to his heels again immediately it was
spoken. There was no hope of finding him in that vastness. If we
yielded, he said, he would arrange the transportation home of our
folk, and Branithar assured him the Wersgor emperor would promise
to keep hands off Terra. If we did not yield, the recreant would go
to Wersgorixan and reveal the truth about us. Then, if necessary,
the foe could recruit enough French or Saracen mercenaries to
destroy us; but probably the demoralization of our allies, as they
learned our weakness, would suffice to bring them to terms. In
either case, Sir Roger would never see his wife and children
again.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Lady Catherine entered the screen. I recall
her words. But I do not choose to write them down. When the record
was ended~ I wiped it out myself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We were silent awhile, my lord and I.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At last: “Well,” he said, like an old
man.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I stared at my feet. “Montbelle said they
would reenter communication range at a certain hour tomorrow, to
bear your decision,” I mumbled. “’Twould be possible to send
numerous . unmanned ships, loaded with explosive fused by a
magnetic nose, along that far-speaker beam. Belike he could be
destroyed.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You’ve already asked much of me, Brother
Parvus,” said Sir Roger. Still his words had no life in them. “Ask
me not to slay my lady and children unshriven.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Aye. Ah, could the vessel be captured? No,”
I answered myself. “Twould be a practical impossibility. Any single
shot which struck close enough to a little ship like that would
more likely make dust of it than merely disable its engines. Or
else the damage would be small, and he would at once flee faster
than light.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The baron raised his congealed face.
“Whatever happens,” he said, “no one is to know my lady’s part in
this. D’you understand? She’s not in her right mind. Some fiend has
possessed her.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I regarded him with a pity still greater
than before. “You’re too brave to hide behind such foolishness,” I
said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well, what can I do?” he growled.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You can fight on-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Hopelessly, once Montbelle has gone to
Wersgorixan.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Or you can accept the terms offered.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ha! How long d’ you think the blueskins
would actually leave Terra in peace?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Sir Owain must have some reason to believe
they will,” I said cautiously.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“He’s a fool.” Sir Roger’s fist smote the
arm of the chair. He sat up straight, and the harshness of his
voice was a lonely token of hopefulness to me. “Or else he’s a
blacker Judas than he has even confessed, and hopes to become
viceroy after the conquest. See you not, ‘tis more than the wish
for land which’ll force the Wersgorix to overrun our planet. ‘Tis
the fact that our race has proven itself mortally dangerous. As
yet, men are helpless at home. But given a few centuries to
prepare, men might well build their own spaceships and overwhelm
the universe.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The Wersorix have suffered in this war,” I
argued feebly. “They II need time to regain what they have lost,
even if our allies surrender all occupied worlds. They might very
likely find it expedient to leave Terra alone for a hundred years
or so.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Till we’re safely dead?” Sir Roger nodded
heavily. “Aye, there’s the great temptation. The real bribe. Yet
would we not burn in hell, if we thus broke faith with unborn
children?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It may be the best we can do for our race,”
I said. “Whatever lies beyond our own power is in the charge of
God.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But no, no, no.” He twisted his hands
together. “I can’t. Better to die now like men. . . . Yet
Catherine- After another stillness, I said, “It may not be too late
to dissuade Sir Owain. No soul is irredeemably lost while this life
remains. You could recall his honor, and point out to him how
foolish it is to rely on Wersgor promises, and offer him
forgiveness and great position-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And the use of my wife?” he jeered.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But in a moment: ‘It may be. I’d far prefer
spill his evil brains. But perhaps ... aye, perhaps a talk... I
would even try to humble myself. Will you aid me, Brother Parvus? I
must not curse him to his face. Will you strengthen my spirit?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc66932267" id="_Toc66932267">Chapter XXI</a></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The next evening, we departed New
Avalon.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger and I went alone, in a tiny
unarmed space lifeboat. We ourselves were but little stronger. I
had my cassock and rosary as always: no more. He was clad in a
yeoman’s doublet and hose, though he wore sword and dagger and his
gilt spurs were on his boots. His big form sat the pilot chair as
it were a saddle, but his eyes, turned heavenward, were full of
winter.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We had told our captains that this was only
a short flight to view some special thing Sir Owain had fetched.
The camp sensed a lie and rumbled with unease. Red John broke two
quarterstaffs before he restored order. It seemed to me as I
embarked that our enterprise was suddenly rusted. Men sat so quiet.
It was a windless evening, our banners drooped on their staffs, and
I noticed how faded and torn they were.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our boat split the blue sky and entered
blackness, like Lucifer expelled. Briefly I glimpsed a battleship,
patrolling in orbit, and would have been much comforted to have
those great guns at my back. But we must take only this helpless
splinter. Sir Owain had made that clear, when we talked a second
time along the far-speaker beam. “If you wish, de Tourneville,
we’ll receive you for a parley. But you must come alone, in a plain
lifeboat, and unarmed.... Oh, very well, you can have your friar,
too.... I shall tell you what orbit to assume. At a certain point
thereof, my ship will meet you. If my telescopes and detectors show
any sign of treachery on your part, I’ll go straight to Wersgorixan
instead.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We accelerated outward through a silence
that thickened. Once I ventured to say, ‘If you two can be
reconciled, it will put heart back in our people. I think then they
would be truly invincible.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Catherine and I?” barked Sir Roger.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Why, I-I-I meant you and Sir Owain-“ I
stammered. But the truth opened up before me: I had indeed been
thinking of the lady. Owain was nothing in himself. Sir Roger was
the one on whom our whole fate rested. Yet he could not continue
much longer, sundered from her who possessed his soul.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She, and the children they had had together,
were the reason he came so meekly to beg Owain’s indulgence.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Outward and outward we fled. The planet
shrank to a tarnished coin behind us. I had not felt so alone
before, not even when we were first borne from our Earth.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But at last a few of the many stars were
obscured. I saw the lean black form of the spaceship grow, as it
matched velocities. We could have tossed a bombshell by hand and
destroyed it. But Sir Owain knew well we would never do that, while
Catherine and Robert and Matilda were aboard. Presently a magnetic
grapnel clanked against our hull. The ships drew together, portal
to portal, a cold kiss. We opened our own gates and waited.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar himself stepped through. Victory
flamed in him. He recoiled when he saw Sir Roger’s glaive and
misericord. “You were to have no weapons!” he rasped.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh? Oh, aye. Aye.” The baron looked dully
down at the blades. “I never thought ... they’re like my spurs,
insignia of what I am ... naught more.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Give them over,” said Branithar.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger unbelted both and handed them to
the Wersgor in their sheaths. Branithar passed them to another blue
and searched our bodies himself. “No hidden guns,” he decided. I
felt my cheeks burn at the insult, but Sir Roger hardly seemed to
notice. “Very well,” said Brarnthar, “follow me.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We went down a corridor to the salon cabin.
Sir Owain sat behind a table of inlaid wood. He himself was somber
in black velvet, but jewels flashed on the hand which covered a
fire-gun laid in front of him. Lady Catherine wore a gray gown and
wimple. She had overlooked a stray lock of hair, which fell across
her brow like smoldering fire.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger halted just within the cabin door.
“Where are the children?” he said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“They are in my bedchamber with the
maidservants.” His wife spoke like a machine. “They are well.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Be seated, sire,” urged Sir Owain glibly.
His gaze flickered about the room. Branithar had lain the sword and
dagger down by him, and stood on his right hand. The other Wersgor,
and a third one who had waited here, stood with folded arms by the
entrance, just behind us. I took them to be the physician and
navigator which had been mentioned, the two gunners must be at
their turrets, the pilot by his controls, in case aught went amiss.
Lady Catherine stood, a waxen image, against the rear wall to
Owain’s left.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You bear no grudges, I trust,” said the
recreant. “All’s fair in love and war.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine lifted a hand to protest. “In war
only.” She could scarce be heard. The hand fell down again.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger and I kept our feet. He spat on
the deck. Owain reddened. ‘Look you,” he exclaimed, “let’s have no
cant about broken vows. Your own position is more than doubtful.
You’ve arrogated to yourself the right of creating noblemen out of
peasants and serfs, disposing of fiefs, dealing with foreign kings.
Why, you’d make yourself king if you could! What then of your
pledges to sovereign Edward?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I’ve done naught to his harm,” Sir Roger
answered, shaken of voice. “If ever I find Terra, I’ll add my
conquests to his domain. Until then, we must manage somehow, and
have no choice but establish our own feudality.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“That may have been the case hitherto,” Sir
Owain admitted. His smile returned. “But you should thank me,
Roger, that I’ve lifted this necessity from you. We can go back
home!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“As Wersgor cattle?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I think not. But do be seated, you two. I
shall have wine and cakes brought. You’re my guests now, you
know.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nay. I’ll not break bread with you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Then you’ll starve to death,” said Sir
Owain merrily.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Roger became like stone. I noticed for the
first time that Lady Catherine wore a holster but that it was
empty. Owain must have gotten her weapon on some pretext. Now he
alone was armed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He turned grave as he read our expressions.
“My lord,” he said, “when you offered to come parley, you could not
expect me to refuse such a chance. You’ll remain with us.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine stirred. “Owain, no!” she cried.
“You never told me-you said he’d be free to leave this ship
if-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He turned his fine profile to her view and
said gently:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Think, my lady. Was it not your highest
wish, to save him? But you wept, fearing his pride would never let
him yield. Now he is a prisoner. Your wish is granted. All the
dishonor is on myself. I bear that burden lightly, since ‘tis for
my lady’s dear sake.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She trembled so I could see it. “I had no
part in this, Roger,” she pleaded. “I never imagined-‘</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Her husband did not look at her. His voice
chopped hers off. “What d’ you plan, Montbelle?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“This new situation has given me new hopes,”
answered the other knight. ‘I confess I was never overly joyed at
thought of bargaining with the Wersgorix. Now ‘tis not needful. We
can go directly home. The weapons and chests of gold aboard this
vessel will win me as much as I care to possess.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Branithar, the only nonhuman there who
understood his English, barked: “Hoy, what of me and my friends
here?’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Owain answered coolly, “Why should you not
accompany us? Without Sir Roger de Tourneville, the English cause
must soon collapse, so you’ll have done your duty to your own
people. I’ve studied your way of thinking-a particular place means
nothing to you. We’ll pick up some females of your race along the
way. As my loyal vassals, you can win as much power and land on
Terra as anywhere else; your descendants will share the planet with
mine. True, you sacrifice a certain amount of wonted social
intercourse, but on the other hand, you fain a degree of liberty
your own government never allowed you.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He had the weapons. Yet I think Branithar
yielded to the argument itself, and that his slow mumble of
agreement was honest.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And us?” breathed Lady Catherine.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You and Roger shall have your estate in
England,” pledged Sir Owain. “I’ll add thereto one at
Winchester.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Perhaps he was also honest. Or perhaps he
thought, once he was the overlord of Europe, he could do as he
wished with her husband and herself. She was too shaken to foresee
the latter chance. I saw her suddenly enclouded with dream. She
faced Sir Roger, smiling and weeping. “My love, we can go home
again!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He glanced at her, once. “But what of the
folk we led hither?” he asked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Nay, I cannot risk taking them with us.”
Sir Owain shrugged. “They’re lowborn anyway.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger nodded. “Ah,” he said. “So.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Once more he looked at his wife. Then he
kicked backward. The spur of knighthood struck into the belly of
the Wersgor behind him. He ripped downward.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Falling with the same motion, he rolled
across the deck. Sir Owain yelled and leaped up. His fire gun
blasted the air. It missed. The baron was too quick, reached
upward, seized the other stupefied Wersgor and pulled him down on
top. The second fire blast struck that living shield.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger heaved the corpse before him,
rising and advancing in one gigantic surge of motion. Owain had
time for a last shot, which charred the dead flesh. Then Roger
threw the body across the table, into the other man’s face.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Owain went down beneath it. Sir Roger
snatched for his sword. Branithar had already put a hand on it. Sir
Roger got the dagger instead. It flared from the sheath. I heard
the thunk as he drove it through Branithar’s hand, into the table,
to the very hilt.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Wait there for me!” snarled Sir Roger. He
drew the sword. “Haro! God send the right!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain had scrambled free and risen,
still clutching the gun. I found myself a-pant just across the
table from him. He aimed squarely at the baron’s midriff. I
promised the saints many candles and smacked my rosary across the
traitor’s wrist. He howled. The gun fell from his hand and skidded
across the table. Sir Roger’s great glaive whistled. Owain was
barely fast enough to dodge. The edged steel crashed into the wood.
A moment Sir Roger must struggle to free it. The fire gun lay on
the deck. I dove for it. So did Lady Catherine, who had dashed
around the table. Our brows met. When my wits came back, I was
sitting up and Roger was chasing Owain out the door.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine screamed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Roger stopped as if noosed. She rose in a
swirl of garments. “The children, my lord! They’re aft, in the
bedchamber-where the extra weapons are-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He cursed and sped out. She followed. I
picked myself up, a trifle groggily, the gun which they had both
forgotten in my grasp. Branithar bared teeth at me. He tugged
against the knife that pinioned him, but only made the blood run
faster. I judged him safely held. My attention was elsewhere. The
Wersgor whom my master had disemboweled was still alive, but would
not remain so for long. A moment I hesitated ... where did my duty
lie, to my lord and his lady or to a dying heathen? ... I bent
above the contorted blue face. ‘Father,” he gasped. I know not who,
or Who, he called upon, but I led him through such poor rites as
the circumstances allowed and held him while he died. I pray he may
at least have won to Limbo.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger came back, wiping his sword. He
grinned all over, I have rarely seen such joy in a man. “The little
wolf!” he whooped. “Aye, Norman blood is ever easy to tell!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What happened?” I asked, rising in my
soiled raiment.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Owain didn’t make for the arms chest after
all,” Sir Roger told me. “He must have turned forward instead, to
the control turret. But the other crewmen, the gunners, had heard
the fight, Judging the chance ripe and the need clear, they went to
equip themselves. I saw one of them pass through the boudoir door.
The other was at his heels, armed with a long wrench. I fell upon
him with my sword, but he fought well and it took a while to get
him slain. Meantime Catherine pursued the first and fought him
barehanded till ~he struck her down. Those chickenheaded
maidservants did naught but cower and scream, as expected. But
then! Listen, Brother Parvus! My son Robert opened the weapon
chest, took forth a gun and plugged that Wersgor as neatly as Red
John could have. Oh, the little devil-cub!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My lady entered. Her braids hung loose, and
one fair cheek was purpled with a bruise. But she said as
impersonally as any sergeant reporting an assignment of pickets: ‘I
quieted the children down.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Poor tiny Matilda,” murmured her husband.
“Was she very much frightened?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Lady Catherine looked indignant. “They both
wanted to come fight!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Wait here,” he said. “I’ll go deal with
Owain and the pilot.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She drew a shaken breath. “Must I forever
hide away when my lord goes into peril?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He stopped still and looked upon her. “But I
thought-‘ he began, oddly helpless.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“That I betrayed you merely to win home
again? Aye.” She stared at the deck. “I think you’ll forgive me for
that long ere I can ever forgive myself. Yet I did what seemed
best... for you, too.... I was confused. ‘Twas like a fever dream.
You should not have left me alone so long, my lord. I missed you
too much.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Very slowly he nodded. “’Tis I who must beg
pardon,” he said. “God grant me years enough to become worthy of
you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Clasping her shoulders: “But remain here.
‘Tis needful you guard yon blueface. If I should kill Owain and the
pilot-“</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Do that!” she cried in upsurging fury.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I’d prefer not,” he said with the same
gentleness as he used toward her. “Looking upon you, I can
understand him so well. But-if worst come to worst-Branithar can
guide us home. So watch him.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She took the gun from me and sat down. The
nailed captive stood rigid with defiance.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Come, Brother Parvus,” said Sir Roger. “I
may need your skill with words.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He carried his sword and had thrust a fire
gun from the weapon chest into his belt. We made our way along a
corridor, up a ramp, and so to the entrance of the control turret.
Its door was shut, locked from within.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Roger beat upon it with the pommel of
his glaive. “You two in there! he shouted. “Yield yourselves!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“And if we do not?” Owain’s voice drifted
faintly through the panels.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“If naught else,” said Roger starkly, “I’ll
wreck the engines and depart in my boat, leaving you adrift. But
see here: I’ve rid myself of anger. Everything has ended for the
best, and we shall indeed go home after these stars have been made
safe for Englishmen. You and I were friends once, Owain. Give me
your hand again. I swear no harm shall come to you.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Silence lay heavy.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Until the man behind the door said: “Aye.
You were never one to break an oath, were you? Very well, come on
through, Roger.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard the bolt click down. The baron put
his hand to the door. I know not what impelled me to say, “Wait,
sire,” and shove myself before him with unheard-of ill manners.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“What is it?” He blinked, bemused in his
gladness.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I opened the door and stepped over the
threshold. Two iron bars smashed down on my head.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The rest of this adventure must needs be
told from hearsay, for I was not to come to my senses for a week. I
toppled in blood, and Sir Roger thought me slain.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The moment they saw it was not the baron
they had gotten, Owain and the pilot attacked him. They were armed
with two unscrewed stanchions, as long and heavy as swords. Sir
Roger’s blade flashed. The pilot threw up his club. The blade
glanced off in a shower of sparks. Sir Roger howled so the walls
echoed. “You murderers of innocence-“ His second blow knocked the
bar out of a numbed hand. At his third, the blue head sprang from
its shoulders and bounced down the ramp.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine heard the uproar. She went to the
door of the salon and looked forward, as if terror could sharpen
her eyes to pierce the walls between. Branithar set his teeth
together. He seized the misericord with his free hand. Muscles
jumped forth in his shoulders. Few men could have drawn that blade,
but Branithar did.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My lady heard the noise and whirled.
Branithar was rounding the table. His right hand hung torn, astream
with blood, but the knife gleamed in his left.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She raised her gun. “Back!” she yelled.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Put that down,” he said scornfully. “You’d
never use it. You never saw enough stars at Terra, with wise enough
vision. If anything goes wrong in the bows, I am your only way
home.’</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She looked into the eyes of her husband’s
enemy, and shot him dead. Then she ran toward the turret.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sir Owain Montbelle had scampered back into
that chamber. He could not fend off the sheer fury of Sir Roger’s
assault. The baron drew his gun. Owain snatched up a book and held
it before his breast.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Have a care!” he panted. “This is the
ship’s log. It has the notes on Terra’s position. There are no
others.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“You lie. There’s Branithar’s mind.”
Nonetheless, Sir Roger thrust the gun back in his belt ~is he
stalked forward. “I’m sorry to outrage clean steel with your blood.
For you killed Brother Parvus and you’re going to die.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Owain poised. His stanchion was a clumsy
weapon. But he raised his arm and hurled it. Struck across the
brow, Sir Roger lurched backward. Owain sprang, snatched the gun
from the stunned man’s belt, and dodged a feeble sword-slash. He
scuttled clear, yelling his triumph. Roger stumbled toward him.
Owain too aim.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Catherine appeared in the door. Her gun
flamed. The book of her journey vanished in smoke and ash. Owain
screamed in anguish. Coldly, she fired again, and he fell.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She flung herself into Roger’s arms and
wept. He comforted her. Yet I wonder which of them gave the most
strength to the other.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Afterward he said ruefully: “I fear we’ve
managed ill. Now the way home is indeed lost.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“It doesn’t matter,” she whispered. “Where
you are, there is England.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Epilogue</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A noise of trumpets and cloven air broke
loose. The captain laid the typescript down and pressed an intercom
button. “What’s going on?” he snapped.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“That eight-legged seneschal up at the
castle finally got hold of his boss, sir,” answered the voice of
the sociotech. “As near as I can make out, the planetary duke was
out on safari, and it took all this while to locate him. He uses a
whole continent for his hunting preserve. Anyhow, he’s just now
arriving. Come see the show. A hundred antigrav aircraft-good
Lord!- the ones that’ve landed are disgorging horsemen!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Ceremonial, no doubt. Just a minute and
I’ll be there.” The captain glared at the typescript. He had read
about halfway through it. How could he talk intelligently to this
fantastic overlord without some inkling of what had really
developed out here?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He skimmed hastily, page after page. The
chronicle of the Wersgor Crusade was long and thunderous. Suffice
it to read the conclusion, how King Roger I was crowned by the
Archbishop of New Canterbury, and reigned for many fruitful
years.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But what had happened? Oh, sure, one way or
another the English won their battles. Eventually they acquired
enough actual strength to be independent of their leader’s luck and
cunning. But their society! How could even their language, let
alone their institutions, have survived contact with old and
sophisticated civilizations? Hang it, why had the sociotech
translated this long-winded Brother Parvus at all, unless some
significant data were included? . .. Wait. Yes. A passage near the
end caught the captain’s eye. He read:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“... I have remarked that Sir Roger de
Tourneville established the feudal system on newly conquered worlds
given into his care by the allies. Some latterday mockers of my
noble master have implied he did this only because he knew nothing
better to do. I refute this. As I said before, the collapse of
Wersgorixan was not unlike the collapse of Rome, and similar
problems found a similar answer. His advantage lay in having that
answer ready to hand, the experience of many Terrestrial
centuries.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“To be sure, each planet was a separate case
requiring separate treatment. However, most of them had certain
important things in common. The native populations were eager to
follow the behest of us, their liberators. Quite apart from
gratitude, they were poor ignorant folk, their own civilizations
long ago obliterated; they needed guidance in all things. By
embracing the Faith, they proved they had souls. This forced our
English clergy to ordain converts in great haste. Father Simon
found texts of Scripture and the Church Fathers to support this
practical necessity-indeed, while he himself never claimed so, it
would seem that the veritable God consecrated him a bishop by
sending him so far out in partibus infidelium. Once this is
granted, it follows that he did not exceed his authority in
planting the seed of our own Catholic church. Of course, in his day
we were always careful to speak of the Archbishop of New Canterbury
as ‘qur’ Pope, or the ‘popelet,’ to remind us that this was a mere
agent of the true Holy Father, whom we could not find. I deplore
the carelessness of the younger generations in this matter of
titles.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oddly enough, no few Wersgorix soon came to
accept the new order. Their central government had always been a
distant thing to them, a mere collector of taxes and enforcer of
arbitrary laws. Many a blueskin found his imagination captured by
our rich ceremonial and by a government of individual nobles whom
he could meet face to face. Moreover, by loyally serving these
overlords, he might hope to regain an estate, or even a title. Of
the Wersgorix who have repented their sins and become valuable
Christian Englishmen, I need only mention our one-time foe Huruga,
whom all this world of Yorkshire honors as Archbishop William.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But there was nothing disingenuous in Sir
Roger’s proceedings. He never betrayed his allies, as some have
charged. He dealt with them shrewdly, but except for the necessary
concealment of our true origin (which mask he dropped as soon as we
had waxed strong enough not to fear exposure) he was aboveboard. It
was not his fault that God always favors the English.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">‘Jairs, Ashenkoghli, and Pr?°tans fell in
with his proposals readily enough. They had no real concept of
empire. If they could have whatever planets without natives we
seized, they were quite happy to leave us humans the immensely
troublesome task of governing that larger number where a slave
population existed. They turned hypocritical eyes away from the
often bloody necessities of such government. I am sure that many of
their politicians secretly rejoiced that each new responsibility of
this sort thinned out the force of their enigmatic associate; for
he must create a duke and lesser gentility for it, then leave that
small garrison to train the aborigines. Uprisings, internecine war,
Wersgor counter-attacks, reduced these tiny cadres still further.
Having little military tradition of their own, the Jairs,
Ashenkoghli and Pr?°tans did not realize how those cruel years
welded bonds of loyalty between native peasants and English
aristocrats. Also, being somewhat effete, they did not foresee how
lustily humans would breed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“So in the end, when all these facts were
pikestaff plain, it was too late. Our allies were still only three
nations, each with its own language and way of life. Springing up
around them were a hundred races, united in Christendom, the
English tongue, and the English crown. Even if we humans had
wished, we could not have changed this. Indeed, we were about as
surprised as anyone.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“As proof that Sir Roger never plotted
against his allies, consider how easily he could have overrun them
in his old age, when he ruled the mightiest nation ever seen among
these stars. But he leaned backward to be generous. It was not his
doing that their own younger generation, awestruck by our
successes, began more and more to imitate our ways. . . .”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The captain put the pages aside and hurried
out to the main airlock entrance. The ramp had been let down, and a
red-haired human giant was striding up to greet him. Fantastically
clad, bearing a florid ornamental sword, he also carried a
businesslike blast gun. Behind him an honor guard of riflemen in
Lincoln green stood at attention. Over their heads fluttered a
banner with the arms of a cadet branch of the great Hameward
family.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The captain’s hand was engulfed in a hairy
ducal paw. The sociotech translated a distorted English: “At last!
God be praised, they’ve finally learned to build spaceships on Old
Earth! Welcome, good sir!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“But why did you never find us ... er ...
your grace?” stammered the captain. When it had been translated,
the duke shrugged and answered:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Oh, we searched. For generations every
young knight went looking for Earth, unless he chose to look for
the Holy Grail. But you know how bloody many suns there are. And
even more toward the center of the galaxy-where we encountered
still other starfaring peoples. Commerce, exploration, war,
everything drew us inward, away from this thinly starred spiral
arm. You realize this is only a poor outlying province you’ve come
upon. The King and the Pope dwell away off in the Seventh
Heaven.... Finally the quest petered out. In past centuries, Old
Earth has become little more than a tradition.” His big face
beamed. “But now it’s all turned topsy-turvy. You found us! Most
wonderful! Tell me at once, has the Holy Land been liberated from
the paynim?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Well,” said Captain Yeshu haLey, who was a
loyal citizen of the Israeli Empire, “yes.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Too bad. I’d have loved a fresh crusade.
Life’s been dull since we conquered the Dragons ten years ago. They
say, however, that the royal expeditions to the Sagittarian star
clouds have turned up some very promising planets- But see here!
You must come over to the castle. I’ll entertain you as best as I
can, and outfit you for the trip to the King. That’s tricky
navigation, but I’ll furnish you with an astrologer who knows the
way.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Now what did he say?” asked Captain haLey,
when the bass burble had stopped.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The sociotech explained.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Captain haLey turned fire color. “No
astrologer is going to touch my ship!”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The sociotech sighed. He’d have a lot of
work to do in the coming years.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&#160;</p>
